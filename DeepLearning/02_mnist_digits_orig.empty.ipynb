The number of epochs is another hyperparameter. In general, we should stop the training as early as possible. Any further epoch can make our model overfit, and therefore generalize poorly.\n",

A larger batch size will probably result in a slightly worse accuracy, but in a better performance. As long as the batch size is not so huge that it cannot be kept in memory. Because we are running on a GPU, it is a good idea to use a power of 2 for the batch size. It will probably make a better use of the GPU.
