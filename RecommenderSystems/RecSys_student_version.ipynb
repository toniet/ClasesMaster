    "Perhaps, one of the most succesful techniques for making personalized recommendations are the so called *collaborative filtering* (CF) algorithms. CF is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue X than to have the opinion on X of a person chosen randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image at the right (from Wikipedia) shows an example of user's preference prediction using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image at the right the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.\n",
