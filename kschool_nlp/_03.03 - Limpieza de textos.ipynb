       "'[Emma by Jane Austen 1816]\\n\\nVOLUME I\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\\nand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings\\nof existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world\\nwith very little to distress or vex her.\\n\\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister\\'s marriage,\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection.\\n\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\\'s family,\\nless as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\\nbut particularly of Emma.  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\\nhighly esteeming Miss Taylor\\'s judgment, but directed chiefly by\\nher own.\\n\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma\\'s situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present\\nso unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her.\\n\\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss\\nTaylor\\'s loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day\\nof this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\\nher father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost.\\n\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  Mr. Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\\nand pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match; but it was a black morning\\'s work for her.\\nThe want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.\\nShe recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed Isabella\\'s marriage, on their\\nbeing left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\\nShe had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault.\\n\\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\\nand a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\\nnatural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he\\nwas no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation,\\nrational or playful.\\n\\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time.\\n\\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\nbeing settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\\nher daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must\\nbe struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next\\nvisit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,\\nto fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.\\n\\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\\nand name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had\\nmany acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\\nTaylor for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and Emma\\ncould not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\\ntill her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.\\nHis spirits required support.  He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\\nfond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\\nhating change of every kind.  Matrimony, as the origin of change,\\nwas always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughter\\'s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\\nhe was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\\nEmma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.  What a pity it\\nis that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.  Mr. Weston is such\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us\\nfor ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?\"\\n\\n\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\nThis is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,\\nmy dear.\"\\n\\n\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\\nus!--We shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.\\nI could not walk half so far.\"\\n\\n\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.  We must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.\"\\n\\n\"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit?\"\\n\\n\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston\\'s stable, papa.  You know we\\nhave settled all that already.  We talked it all over with Mr. Weston\\nlast night.  And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to Randalls, because of his daughter\\'s being housemaid there.\\nI only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was\\nyour doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought\\nof Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad I did think of her.  It was very lucky, for I would\\nnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;\\nand I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\npretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.  Whenever I see her,\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.\\nI am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see.  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,\\nshe will be hearing of us.  He will be able to tell her how we\\nall are.\"\\n\\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\\nand hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.\\nThe backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella\\'s husband.\\nHe lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,\\nand always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had\\nreturned to a late dinner, after some days\\' absence, and now walked\\nup to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.\\nIt was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.\\nMr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\\nand his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily.  When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse\\ngratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us.  I am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, sir.  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\\nthat I must draw back from your great fire.\"\\n\\n\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.  I wish you may\\nnot catch cold.\"\\n\\n\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.  Not a speck on them.\"\\n\\n\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here.  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\\n\\n\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry\\nwith my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.\\nHow did you all behave? Who cried most?\"\\n\\n\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! \\'Tis a sad business.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\\nsay `poor Miss Taylor.\\' I have a great regard for you and Emma;\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At\\nany rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"\\n\\n\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!\"\\nsaid Emma playfully.  \"That is what you have in your head,\\nI know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\\n\\n\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a sigh.  \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose\\nMr. Knightley to mean _you_.  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant\\nonly myself.  Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--\\nin a joke--it is all a joke.  We always say what we like to one another.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,\\nshe knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would\\nnot have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\\nthought perfect by every body.\\n\\n\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I\\nmeant no reflection on any body.  Miss Taylor has been used\\nto have two persons to please; she will now have but one.\\nThe chances are that she must be a gainer.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear\\nabout the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all\\nbehaved charmingly.  Every body was punctual, every body in their\\nbest looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no;\\nwe all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,\\nand were sure of meeting every day.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father.\\n\"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,\\nand I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\\n\\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.\\n\"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley.  \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir,\\nif we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nMiss Taylor\\'s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,\\nat Miss Taylor\\'s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.\\nEvery friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried.\"\\n\\n\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma,\\n\"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.\\nI made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,\\nand be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again, may comfort me for any thing.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her.  Her father fondly replied,\\n\"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,\\nfor whatever you say always comes to pass.  Pray do not make any\\nmore matches.\"\\n\\n\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,\\nfor other people.  It is the greatest amusement in the world! And\\nafter such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again.  Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower\\nso long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--\\nMr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it.  Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.\\nSome people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him.  All manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none\\nof it.\\n\\n\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\\nmet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from Farmer Mitchell\\'s, I made up my mind on the subject.\\nI planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave\\noff match-making.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by `success,\\'\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\"Success supposes endeavour.  Your time has been properly and\\ndelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four\\nyears to bring about this marriage.  A worthy employment for a young\\nlady\\'s mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,\\nas you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself\\none idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor\\nif Mr. Weston were to marry her,\\' and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where\\nis your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess;\\nand _that_ is all that can be said.\"\\n\\n\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--\\nI pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky\\nguess is never merely luck.  There is always some talent in it.\\nAnd as to my poor word `success,\\' which you quarrel with, I do not\\nknow that I am so entirely without any claim to it.  You have drawn\\ntwo pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something\\nbetween the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston\\'s\\nvisits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed\\nmany little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.\\nI think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.\"\\n\\n\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns.  You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,\\nthan good to them, by interference.\"\\n\\n\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\"\\nrejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.  \"But, my dear,\\npray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up\\none\\'s family circle grievously.\"\\n\\n\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.  Poor Mr. Elton! You\\nlike Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him.\\nThere is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been\\nhere a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,\\nthat it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought\\nwhen he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if\\nhe would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think\\nvery well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing\\nhim a service.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very\\ngood young man, and I have a great regard for him.  But if you\\nwant to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come\\nand dine with us some day.  That will be a much better thing.\\nI dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.\"\\n\\n\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\nlaughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much\\nbetter thing.  Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best\\nof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.\\nDepend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care\\nof himself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property.  He had received a good education, but,\\non succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become\\nindisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\\nwere engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social\\ntemper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\\n\\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\\nof a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\\nwith him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\\nwho had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\\nwhich the connexion would offend.\\n\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\\nof her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\\ntook place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\\nwho threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion,\\nand did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found\\nmore in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\\nshe had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brother\\'s unreasonable anger,\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond\\ntheir income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\\nshe did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\\n\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years\\' marriage,\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.\\nThe boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mother\\'s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.\\nSome scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\\nto have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could.\\n\\nA complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.\\nIt was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still\\na small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.\\nHe had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\\nalways longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition.\\n\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\\nlooked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\\nin view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,\\nbought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man;\\nhis own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\\namiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it.\\n\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\\nhis own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought\\nup as his uncle\\'s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption\\nas to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.\\nIt was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\\nfather\\'s assistance.  His father had no apprehension of it.\\nThe aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;\\nbut it was not in Mr. Weston\\'s nature to imagine that any caprice\\ncould be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,\\nso deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,\\nand was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.\\nHe was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\\nmerits and prospects a kind of common concern.\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life.  His coming\\nto visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.\\n\\nNow, upon his father\\'s marriage, it was very generally proposed,\\nas a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.\\nThere was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when\\nMrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates returned the visit.  Now was the time for Mr. Frank\\nChurchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was\\nunderstood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.\\nFor a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention\\nof the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.  \"I suppose you\\nhave heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written\\nto Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.\\nMr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he\\nsays he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,\\nand a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\\nof congratulation which her marriage had already secured.  She felt\\nherself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.\\n\\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\\nwithout pain, of Emma\\'s losing a single pleasure, or suffering\\nan hour\\'s ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear\\nEmma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations.  And then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston\\'s\\ndisposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together.\\n\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her\\nsatisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,\\nwas so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,\\nwas sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\\n`poor Miss Taylor,\\' when they left her at Randalls in the centre\\nof every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening\\nattended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.\\nBut never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\\'s giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\"\\n\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of\\nceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation\\nto Mr. Woodhouse.  The compliments of his neighbours were over;\\nhe was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;\\nand the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,\\nwas all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he\\ncould never believe other people to be different from himself.\\nWhat was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;\\nand he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\\nany wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly\\ntried to prevent any body\\'s eating it.  He had been at the pains\\nof consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.  Mr. Perry\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s life; and upon being applied to,\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the\\nbias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree\\nwith many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.\\nWith such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped\\nto influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the\\ncake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\\nit was all gone.\\n\\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys\\nbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston\\'s wedding-cake in their\\nhands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much\\nto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,\\nfrom his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,\\nfrom his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the\\nvisits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.\\nHe had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;\\nhis horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit\\nfor any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.\\nFortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,\\nand Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,\\ncomprehended many such.  Not unfrequently, through Emma\\'s persuasion,\\nhe had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening\\nparties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any\\ntime unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week\\nin which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.\\n\\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;\\nand by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,\\nthe privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\nfor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s drawing-room,\\nand the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being\\nthrown away.\\n\\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able\\nof whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies\\nalmost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,\\nand who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse\\nthought it no hardship for either James or the horses.  Had it\\ntaken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.\\n\\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a\\nvery old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.\\nShe lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was\\nconsidered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,\\nunder such untoward circumstances, can excite.  Her daughter enjoyed\\na most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,\\nhandsome, rich, nor married.  Miss Bates stood in the very worst\\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour;\\nand she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,\\nor frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.\\nShe had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.  Her youth\\nhad passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible.  And yet she was a happy woman,\\nand a woman whom no one named without good-will.  It was her own\\nuniversal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.\\nShe loved every body, was interested in every body\\'s happiness,\\nquicksighted to every body\\'s merits; thought herself a most fortunate\\ncreature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,\\nand so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted\\nfor nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,\\nher contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,\\nand a mine of felicity to herself.  She was a great talker upon\\nlittle matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial\\ncommunications and harmless gossip.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,\\nor an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for\\nenormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but\\na real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,\\nand where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble\\nthemselves into a little education, without any danger of coming\\nback prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard\\'s school was in high repute--and\\nvery deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\\nspot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty\\nof wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,\\nand in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.\\nIt was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church.  She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled\\nto the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly\\nowed much to Mr. Woodhouse\\'s kindness, felt his particular claim\\non her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,\\nwhenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\\n\\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently\\nable to collect; and happy was she, for her father\\'s sake,\\nin the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,\\nit was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.  She was delighted\\nto see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\\nherself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings\\nof three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\\nwas indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\\n\\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close\\nof the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,\\nin most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;\\na most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,\\nwhom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,\\non account of her beauty.  A very gracious invitation was returned,\\nand the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\\n\\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.  Somebody had\\nplaced her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard\\'s school,\\nand somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar\\nto that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known\\nof her history.  She had no visible friends but what had been\\nacquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit\\nin the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.\\n\\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich Emma particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair,\\nwith a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,\\nand a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,\\nEmma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite\\ndetermined to continue the acquaintance.\\n\\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith\\'s\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly\\nimpressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\\nto what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,\\nand deserve encouragement.  Encouragement should be given.\\nThose soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be\\nwasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.\\nThe acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.\\nThe friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort\\nof people, must be doing her harm.  They were a family of the name\\nof Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm\\nof Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,\\nshe believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they\\nmust be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates\\nof a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\nto be quite perfect.  _She_ would notice her; she would improve her;\\nshe would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.\\nIt would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;\\nhighly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\\n\\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking\\nand listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that\\nthe evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,\\nwhich always closed such parties, and for which she had been\\nused to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,\\nand moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an\\nalacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\\nindifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,\\nwith the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,\\ndid she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend\\nthe minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she\\nknew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.\\n\\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.\\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion\\nof his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\\nmade him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his\\nhospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,\\nhis care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.\\n\\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that\\nhe could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he\\nmight constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing\\nthe nicer things, to say:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.\\nAn egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling\\nan egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled\\nby any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,\\nyou see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates,\\nlet Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit.\\nOurs are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome\\npreserves here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard, what say\\nyou to _half_ a glass of wine? A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler\\nof water? I do not think it could disagree with you.\"\\n\\nEmma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in\\na much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had\\nparticular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness\\nof Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.  Miss Woodhouse\\nwas so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the\\nintroduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,\\ngrateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,\\ndelighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated\\nher all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHarriet Smith\\'s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.\\nQuick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,\\nso did their satisfaction in each other.  As a walking companion,\\nEmma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston\\'s loss had been important.  Her father\\nnever went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground\\nsufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;\\nand since Mrs. Weston\\'s marriage her exercise had been too much confined.\\nShe had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;\\nand a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any\\ntime to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.\\nBut in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,\\nand was confirmed in all her kind designs.\\n\\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,\\ngrateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring\\nto be guided by any one she looked up to.  Her early attachment\\nto herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,\\nand power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that\\nthere was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must\\nnot be expected.  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet\\nSmith\\'s being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the\\nsomething which her home required.  Such a friend as Mrs. Weston\\nwas out of the question.  Two such could never be granted.\\nTwo such she did not want.  It was quite a different sort of thing,\\na sentiment distinct and independent.  Mrs. Weston was the object\\nof a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.\\nFor Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\\n\\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell.  She was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.\\nEmma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never\\nbelieve that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered\\nthe truth.  Harriet had no penetration.  She had been satisfied\\nto hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;\\nand looked no farther.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and\\nbut for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,\\nit must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts\\na good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place.  Emma encouraged her\\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin\\'s having \"_two_ parlours, two very good parlours,\\nindeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard\\'s drawing-room;\\nand of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years\\nwith her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,\\nand one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;\\nand of Mrs. Martin\\'s saying as she was so fond of it, it should be\\ncalled _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house\\nin their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink\\ntea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.\"\\n\\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;\\nbut as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.\\nShe had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,\\na son and son\\'s wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared\\nthat the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always\\nmentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something\\nor other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,\\nno wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she\\nwere not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\\n\\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number\\nand meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it.  Harriet was very ready\\nto speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured\\nand obliging.  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring\\nher some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,\\nand in every thing else he was so very obliging.  He had his\\nshepherd\\'s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\\nShe was very fond of singing.  He could sing a little himself.\\nShe believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.\\nHe had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,\\nhe had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.\\nShe believed every body spoke well of him.  His mother and sisters\\nwere very fond of him.  Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there\\nwas a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\\nto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,\\nhe would make a good husband.  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.\\nShe was in no hurry at all.\\n\\n\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma.  \"You know what you are about.\"\\n\\n\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had\\never seen.  Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all\\nthe three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,\\nto sup with her.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line\\nof his own business? He does not read?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has\\nread a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.\\nHe reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay\\nin one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself.\\nBut sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read\\nsomething aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.\\nAnd I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.  He never read the\\nRomance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.  He had never\\nheard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined\\nto get them now as soon as ever he can.\"\\n\\nThe next question was--\\n\\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.  I thought him very plain\\nat first, but I do not think him so plain now.  One does not, you know,\\nafter a time.  But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every\\nnow and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way\\nto Kingston.  He has passed you very often.\"\\n\\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without\\nhaving any idea of his name.  A young farmer, whether on horseback\\nor on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.\\nThe yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I\\ncan have nothing to do.  A degree or two lower, and a creditable\\nappearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their\\nfamilies in some way or other.  But a farmer can need none of my help,\\nand is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every\\nother he is below it.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure.  Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have\\nobserved him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.\\nI know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.\\nWhat do you imagine his age to be?\"\\n\\n\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is\\nthe 23rd just a fortnight and a day\\'s difference--which is very odd.\"\\n\\n\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.  His mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry.  They seem very comfortable\\nas they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,\\nshe would probably repent it.  Six years hence, if he could meet\\nwith a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,\\nwith a little money, it might be very desirable.\"\\n\\n\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\\n\\n\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,\\nwho are not born to an independence.  Mr. Martin, I imagine,\\nhas his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with\\nthe world.  Whatever money he might come into when his father died,\\nwhatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,\\nall afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,\\nwith diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to\\nimpossible that he should have realised any thing yet.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, so it is.  But they live very comfortably.\\nThey have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;\\nand Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though\\nhis sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether\\nobjected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit\\nfor you to notice.  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you\\nparticularly careful as to your associates.  There can be no doubt\\nof your being a gentleman\\'s daughter, and you must support your\\nclaim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there\\nwill be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.  But while I visit\\nat Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,\\nI am not afraid of what any body can do.\"\\n\\n\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.  I want to see you\\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable\\nto have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say\\nthat if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,\\nI wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,\\nto be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere\\nfarmer\\'s daughter, without education.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure.  Yes.  Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some education--and been very well brought up.\\nHowever, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your\\'s--and I\\nam sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.  I shall\\nalways have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,\\nand should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well\\neducated as me.  But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,\\ncertainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,\\nand saw no alarming symptoms of love.  The young man had been\\nthe first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,\\nand that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet\\'s side,\\nto oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.\\n\\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\nDonwell road.  He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully\\nat her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.\\nEmma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;\\nand walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made\\nher quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.\\nHis appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,\\nbut his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be\\ncontrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground\\nhe had gained in Harriet\\'s inclination.  Harriet was not insensible\\nof manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father\\'s gentleness\\nwith admiration as well as wonder.  Mr. Martin looked as if he\\ndid not know what manner was.\\n\\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must\\nnot be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a\\nsmiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse\\nhoped very soon to compose.\\n\\n\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was\\nquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.\\nHe did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked\\ntowards Randalls most days.  He has not been able to get the\\nRomance of the Forest yet.  He was so busy the last time he was\\nat Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.\\nSo very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he\\nlike what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him\\nso very plain?\"\\n\\n\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is\\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no\\nright to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no\\nidea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.\\nI had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not\\nso genteel as real gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,\\nthat you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.\\nAt Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,\\nwell bred men.  I should be surprized if, after seeing them,\\nyou could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving\\nhim to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at\\nyourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.\\nDo not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure\\nyou must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,\\nand the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated\\nas I stood here.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.  He has not such a fine\\nair and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.  I see the difference\\nplain enough.  But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley\\'s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair\\nto compare Mr. Martin with _him_.  You might not see one in a hundred\\nwith _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.  But he is\\nnot the only gentleman you have been lately used to.  What say you\\nto Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_.\\nCompare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;\\nof being silent.  You must see the difference.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.  But Mr. Weston is almost\\nan old man.  Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"\\n\\n\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.  The older a\\nperson grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners\\nshould not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,\\nor coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.  What is passable in youth\\nis detestable in later age.  Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;\\nwhat will he be at Mr. Weston\\'s time of life?\"\\n\\n\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.\\n\\n\"But there may be pretty good guessing.  He will be a completely gross,\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking\\nof nothing but profit and loss.\"\\n\\n\"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\"\\n\\n\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.  What has\\nhe to do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive,\\nand be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse\\nneed not disturb _us_.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet\\'s answer,\\nand spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might\\nbe safely left to itself.  She, therefore, said no more for some time.\\nHer next beginning was,\\n\\n\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\'s manners are superior\\nto Mr. Knightley\\'s or Mr. Weston\\'s. They have more gentleness.\\nThey might be more safely held up as a pattern.  There is an openness,\\na quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body\\nlikes in _him_, because there is so much good-humour with it--but\\nthat would not do to be copied.  Neither would Mr. Knightley\\'s\\ndownright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits\\n_him_ very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem\\nto allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,\\nhe would not be sufferable.  On the contrary, I think a young man\\nmight be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.\\nMr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\\nHe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.  I do not\\nknow whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either\\nof us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his\\nmanners are softer than they used to be.  If he means any thing,\\nit must be to please you.  Did not I tell you what he said of you\\nthe other day?\"\\n\\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn\\nfrom Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed\\nand smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\\n\\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving\\nthe young farmer out of Harriet\\'s head.  She thought it would\\nbe an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,\\nand probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.\\nShe feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.\\nIt was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled\\nher in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during\\nthe very first evening of Harriet\\'s coming to Hartfield.  The longer\\nshe considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.\\nMr. Elton\\'s situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,\\nand without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family\\nthat could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.  He had a\\ncomfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;\\nfor though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly\\nof him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,\\nwithout any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\\n\\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,\\nwas foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet\\'s there could be\\nlittle doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all\\nthe usual weight and efficacy.  And he was really a very pleasing\\nyoung man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.\\nHe was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,\\nthough not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which\\nshe could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified\\nby a Robert Martin\\'s riding about the country to get walnuts\\nfor her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton\\'s admiration.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"of\\nthis great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.\"\\n\\n\"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"\\n\\n\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\"\\n\\n\"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her\\nwith a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.\\nI have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.\\nHow very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any\\ngood! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels\\nabout Emma, Mr. Knightley.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,\\nknowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,\\nfor he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.  We were speaking\\nof it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,\\nthat there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.\\nMr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.\\nYou are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value\\nof a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort\\na woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used\\nto it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.\\nShe is not the superior young woman which Emma\\'s friend ought to be.\\nBut on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,\\nit will be an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will\\nread together.  She means it, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve\\nyears old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at\\nvarious times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and\\nvery good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly\\narranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.\\nThe list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it\\ndid her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;\\nand I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I\\nhave done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.\\nShe will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,\\nand a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor\\nfailed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do\\nnothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you\\nwished.--You know you could not.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought\\nso _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma\\'s\\nomitting to do any thing I wished.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\"--said\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.  \"But I,\"\\nhe soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,\\nmust still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the\\ncleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the misfortune of\\nbeing able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.\\nShe was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.\\nAnd ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house\\nand of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope\\nwith her.  She inherits her mother\\'s talents, and must have been\\nunder subjection to her.\"\\n\\n\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on\\n_your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse\\'s family and wanted\\nanother situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for\\nme to any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling.  \"You are better placed _here_; very fit\\nfor a wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing\\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.\\nYou might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would\\nseem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_,\\non the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,\\nand doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend\\nhim a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife\\nto such a man as Mr. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,\\nand that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing\\nto be borne.  We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross\\nfrom the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\"\\n\\n\"Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma\\'s\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart,\\nthe young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\\nHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think\\nher the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.\\nShe knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.\\nShe is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,\\nbecause undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can\\nEmma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet\\nis presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,\\nI will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance.\\nHartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places\\nshe belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable\\nwith those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.\\nI am much mistaken if Emma\\'s doctrines give any strength of mind,\\nor tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties\\nof her situation in life.--They only give a little polish.\"\\n\\n\"I either depend more upon Emma\\'s good sense than you do, or am more\\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\\nHow well she looked last night!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?\\nVery well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma\\'s being pretty.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer\\nperfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have\\nseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.\\nBut I am a partial old friend.\"\\n\\n\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,\\nher glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture\\nof health;\\' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete\\npicture of grown-up health.  She is loveliness itself.  Mr. Knightley,\\nis not she?\"\\n\\n\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied.\\n\"I think her all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I\\nwill add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.\\nConsidering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little\\noccupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am\\nnot to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread\\nof its doing them both harm.\"\\n\\n\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its\\nnot doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma\\'s little faults,\\nshe is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,\\nor a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities\\nwhich may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;\\nshe will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the\\nright a hundred times.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,\\nand I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John\\nand Isabella.  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore\\nnot a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;\\nexcept when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.\\nI am sure of having their opinions with me.\"\\n\\n\"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma\\'s\\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think\\nany possible good can arise from Harriet Smith\\'s intimacy being made\\na matter of much discussion among you.  Pray excuse me; but supposing\\nany little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,\\nit cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,\\nwho perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,\\nso long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so\\nmany years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,\\nMr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" cried he; \"I am much obliged to you for it.\\nIt is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your\\nadvice has often found; for it shall be attended to.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy\\nabout her sister.\"\\n\\n\"Be satisfied,\" said he, \"I will not raise any outcry.  I will keep\\nmy ill-humour to myself.  I have a very sincere interest in Emma.\\nIsabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a\\ngreater interest; perhaps hardly so great.  There is an anxiety,\\na curiosity in what one feels for Emma.  I wonder what will become\\nof her!\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said Mrs. Weston gently, \"very much.\"\\n\\n\"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,\\nmeans just nothing at all.  But I have no idea that she has yet\\never seen a man she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her\\nto be very much in love with a proper object.  I should like to see\\nEmma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.\\nBut there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom\\nfrom home.\"\\n\\n\"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break\\nher resolution at present,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"as can well be;\\nand while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be\\nforming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties\\non poor Mr. Woodhouse\\'s account.  I do not recommend matrimony\\nat present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.\"\\n\\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of\\nher own and Mr. Weston\\'s on the subject, as much as possible.\\nThere were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma\\'s destiny, but it\\nwas not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition\\nwhich Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to \"What does Weston\\nthink of the weather; shall we have rain?\" convinced her that he\\nhad nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet\\'s fancy\\na proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity\\nto a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible\\nthan before of Mr. Elton\\'s being a remarkably handsome man, with most\\nagreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up\\nthe assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon\\npretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet\\'s side,\\nas there could be any occasion for.  She was quite convinced\\nof Mr. Elton\\'s being in the fairest way of falling in love,\\nif not in love already.  She had no scruple with regard to him.\\nHe talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.\\nHis perception of the striking improvement of Harriet\\'s manner,\\nsince her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least\\nagreeable proofs of his growing attachment.\\n\\n\"You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\" said he;\\n\"you have made her graceful and easy.  She was a beautiful creature\\nwhen she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have\\nadded are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet\\nonly wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.\\nShe had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness\\nin herself.  I have done very little.\"\\n\\n\"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\" said the gallant\\nMr. Elton--\\n\\n\"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,\\nhave taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her\\nway before.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.  So much superadded\\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\"\\n\\n\"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.  I never met with\\na disposition more truly amiable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it.\" And it was spoken with a sort\\nof sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.\\nShe was not less pleased another day with the manner\\nin which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet\\'s picture.\\n\\n\"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\" said she: \"did\\nyou ever sit for your picture?\"\\n\\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\\nwith a very interesting naivete,\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, no, never.\"\\n\\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\\n\\n\"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\\ngive any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had\\na great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of\\nmy friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.\\nBut from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.\\nBut really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.\\nIt would be such a delight to have her picture!\"\\n\\n\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a delight!\\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a\\ntalent in favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are.\\nHow could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in\\nspecimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston\\nsome inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\"\\n\\nYes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing.  Don\\'t pretend to be\\nin raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet\\'s face.\\n\"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe\\nI shall try what I can do.  Harriet\\'s features are very delicate,\\nwhich makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity\\nin the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought\\nto catch.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I\\nhave not a doubt of your success.  Pray, pray attempt it.\\nAs you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,\\nbe an exquisite possession.\"\\n\\n\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.\\nShe thinks so little of her own beauty.  Did not you observe her\\nmanner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my\\npicture be drawn?\\'\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.  It was not lost on me.\\nBut still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"\\n\\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest\\npressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work directly,\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts\\nat portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they\\nmight decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many\\nbeginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.\\nShe had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress\\nboth in drawing and music than many might have done with so little\\nlabour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew\\nin almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;\\nand in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\\nwould have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.\\nShe was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\\nor a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,\\nor sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\\nthan it deserved.\\n\\nThere was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;\\nher style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\\nwould have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A likeness\\npleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse\\'s performances must be capital.\\n\\n\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma.  \"I had only my\\nown family to study from.  There is my father--another of my\\nfather--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,\\nthat I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very\\nlike therefore.  Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.\\nDear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.\\nShe would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really\\nquite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.\\nI should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have\\nsat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four\\nchildren that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four children;--there they are,\\nHenry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,\\nand any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so\\neager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no\\nmaking children of three or four years old stand still you know;\\nnor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the\\nair and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any\\nof mama\\'s children ever were.  Here is my sketch of the fourth,\\nwho was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it\\nis as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.\\nHe had nestled down his head most conveniently.  That\\'s very like.\\nI am rather proud of little George.  The corner of the sofa is very good.\\nThen here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\nin small size, whole-length--\"my last and my best--my brother,\\nMr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I\\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.\\nI could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I\\nhad really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I\\nwere quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too\\nflattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after\\nall this, came poor dear Isabella\\'s cold approbation of--\"Yes,\\nit was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.\"\\nWe had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.\\nIt was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I\\ncould bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised\\nover as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in\\nBrunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing\\nany body again.  But for Harriet\\'s sake, or rather for my own,\\nand as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_,\\nI will break my resolution now.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,\\nand was repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present\\nindeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,\"\\nwith so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider\\nwhether she had not better leave them together at once.  But as she\\nwanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.\\n\\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.\\nIt was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John\\nKnightley\\'s, and was destined, if she could please herself,\\nto hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.\\n\\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid\\nof not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet\\nmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.\\nBut there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind\\nher and watching every touch.  She gave him credit for stationing\\nhimself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;\\nbut was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to\\nplace himself elsewhere.  It then occurred to her to employ him\\nin reading.\\n\\n\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith\\'s.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton was only too happy.  Harriet listened, and Emma drew\\nin peace.  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;\\nany thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;\\nand he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,\\nto jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no\\nbeing displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration\\nmade him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.\\nShe could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance\\nwere unexceptionable.\\n\\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite\\nenough pleased with the first day\\'s sketch to wish to go on.\\nThere was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,\\nand as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,\\nto give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had\\ngreat confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,\\nand of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a\\nstanding memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,\\nand the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations\\nas Mr. Elton\\'s very promising attachment was likely to add.\\n\\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\\n\\n\"By all means.  We shall be most happy to consider you as one\\nof the party.\"\\n\\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress\\nof the picture, which was rapid and happy.  Every body who saw it\\nwas pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended\\nit through every criticism.\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting\\nthat she was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is\\nmost correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.\\nIt is the fault of her face that she has them not.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" replied he.  \"I cannot agree with you.\\nIt appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.\\nI never saw such a likeness in my life.  We must allow for the effect\\nof shade, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,\\n\\n\"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.  Consider,\\nshe is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which\\nin short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must\\nbe preserved, you know.  Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it\\ngives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith\\'s. Exactly so indeed!\"\\n\\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Mr. Woodhouse.  \"So prettily done! Just\\nas your drawings always are, my dear.  I do not know any body who draws\\nso well as you do.  The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,\\nthat she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl\\nover her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\\nLook at the tree.\"\\n\\n\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess\\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss\\nSmith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable\\nspirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character.\\nThe naivete of Miss Smith\\'s manners--and altogether--Oh, it is\\nmost admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.  I never saw such\\na likeness.\"\\n\\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\\nfew difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\\ncould be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\\nmust not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs\\nof December.  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,\\nthan it was removed.  His gallantry was always on the alert.\\n\"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure\\nshould he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.\\nIt was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being\\nemployed on such an errand.\"\\n\\n\"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would\\nnot give him such a troublesome office for the world,\"--brought\\non the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and\\na very few minutes settled the business.\\n\\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,\\nand give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it\\nas to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he\\nseemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.\\n\\n\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he\\nreceived it.\\n\\n\"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\" thought Emma.\\n\"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different\\nways of being in love.  He is an excellent young man, and will suit\\nHarriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,\\' as he says himself;\\nbut he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more\\nthan I could endure as a principal.  I come in for a pretty good\\nshare as a second.  But it is his gratitude on Harriet\\'s account.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThe very day of Mr. Elton\\'s going to London produced a fresh occasion\\nfor Emma\\'s services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,\\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home\\nto return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\\ntalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.\\nHalf a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got\\nback to Mrs. Goddard\\'s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,\\nand finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left\\na little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;\\nand on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two\\nsongs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;\\nand this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct\\nproposal of marriage.  \"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized\\nshe did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;\\nand a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote\\nas if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,\\nshe was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she\\nshould do.--\" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so\\npleased and so doubtful.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" she cried, \"the young man is determined not to lose\\nany thing for want of asking.  He will connect himself well if he can.\"\\n\\n\"Will you read the letter?\" cried Harriet.  \"Pray do.  I\\'d rather\\nyou would.\"\\n\\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized.\\nThe style of the letter was much above her expectation.\\nThere were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it\\nwould not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,\\nwas strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much\\nto the credit of the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense,\\nwarm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.\\nShe paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for\\nher opinion, with a \"Well, well,\" and was at last forced to add,\\n\"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so\\ngood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of\\nhis sisters must have helped him.  I can hardly imagine the young\\nman whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself\\nso well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the\\nstyle of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;\\nnot diffuse enough for a woman.  No doubt he is a sensible man,\\nand I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and\\nclearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find\\nproper words.  It is so with some men.  Yes, I understand the sort\\nof mind.  Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,\\nnot coarse.  A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)\\nthan I had expected.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the still waiting Harriet;--\"well--and--and what\\nshall I do?\"\\n\\n\"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard\\nto this letter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.  You will\\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure.  There is no danger of your\\nnot being intelligible, which is the first thing.  Your meaning must\\nbe unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,\\nwill present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded.\\nYou need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow\\nfor his disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.\\n\\n\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you\\nin any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I\\nhave been under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding\\nyou, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.\\nI had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.\"\\n\\nHarriet was silent.  With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\\n\\n\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would\\nyou advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I\\nought to do.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.  I will have nothing to\\ndo with it.  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\\ncontemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered\\nin her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery\\nof that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\\n\\n\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_\\nas to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought\\nto refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to `Yes,\\' she ought to say\\n`No\\' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into\\nwith doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty\\nas a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you.\\nBut do not imagine that I want to influence you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you\\nwould just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean\\nthat--As you say, one\\'s mind ought to be quite made up--One should\\nnot be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer\\nto say `No,\\' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?\\'\"\\n\\n\"Not for the world,\" said Emma, smiling graciously, \"would I advise\\nyou either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness.\\nIf you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him\\nthe most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should\\nyou hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you\\nat this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not\\ndeceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.\\nAt this moment whom are you thinking of?\"\\n\\nThe symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned\\naway confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though\\nthe letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted\\nabout without regard.  Emma waited the result with impatience,\\nbut not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation,\\nHarriet said--\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must\\ndo as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,\\nand really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.  Do you\\nthink I am right?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\\nwhat you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings\\nto myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no\\nhesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.\\nIt would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have\\nbeen the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in\\nthe smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would\\nnot influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.\\nI could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.\\nNow I am secure of you for ever.\"\\n\\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck\\nher forcibly.\\n\\n\"You could not have visited me!\" she cried, looking aghast.\\n\"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.\\nThat would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,\\nI would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you\\nfor any thing in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;\\nbut it must have been.  You would have thrown yourself out of all\\ngood society.  I must have given you up.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed\\nme never to come to Hartfield any more!\"\\n\\n\"Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!\\nI wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.\\nHe must have a pretty good opinion of himself.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think he is conceited either, in general,\" said Harriet,\\nher conscience opposing such censure; \"at least, he is very good natured,\\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\\nfor--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,\\nthough he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and\\ncertainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen\\npeople--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,\\nthere is no comparison at all, _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable.\\nHowever, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,\\nand have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached\\nto me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,\\nit is what I would not do upon any consideration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not\\nbe parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,\\nor because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\"\\n\\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a\\n\"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the\\nclownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,\\nto know that her husband could write a good letter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, very.  Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions.  I am quite determined to refuse him.\\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?\"\\n\\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,\\nand advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,\\nin the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest\\nagainst any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the\\nformation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again,\\nin replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was\\nparticularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;\\nand she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,\\nand thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,\\nand was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,\\nthat Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,\\nhe would have been accepted after all.\\n\\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.\\nThe business was finished, and Harriet safe.  She was rather low\\nall the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,\\nand sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection,\\nsometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.\\n\\n\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather\\na sorrowful tone.\\n\\n\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.\\nYou are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared\\nto Abbey-Mill.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\\nbut at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nSome time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very\\nmuch surprized if she knew what had happened.  I am sure Miss Nash\\nwould--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,\\nand it is only a linen-draper.\"\\n\\n\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the\\nteacher of a school, Harriet.  I dare say Miss Nash would envy you\\nsuch an opportunity as this of being married.  Even this conquest\\nwould appear valuable in her eyes.  As to any thing superior for you,\\nI suppose she is quite in the dark.  The attentions of a certain\\nperson can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.\\nHitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks\\nand manners have explained themselves.\"\\n\\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering\\nthat people should like her so much.  The idea of Mr. Elton was\\ncertainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted\\nagain towards the rejected Mr. Martin.\\n\\n\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly.  \"I wonder what they\\nare all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,\\nthey will be unhappy too.  I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"\\n\\n\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more\\ncheerfully employed,\" cried Emma.  \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\nis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much\\nmore beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five\\nor six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"\\n\\n\"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"\\n\\n\"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.  No, my dear\\nlittle modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be\\nin Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.\\nIt is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.\\nIt opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,\\nit diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature,\\neager curiosity and warm prepossession.  How cheerful, how animated,\\nhow suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!\"\\n\\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she\\nhad been spending more than half her time there, and gradually\\ngetting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma\\njudged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her\\nwith them as much as possible just at present.  She was obliged\\nto go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\\nbut it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,\\nto make a regular visit of some days.\\n\\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with\\nMr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up\\nhis mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,\\nand was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples\\nof his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.\\nMr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering\\nby his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted\\napologies and civil hesitations of the other.\\n\\n\"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you\\nwill not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take\\nEmma\\'s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun\\nis out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.\\nI treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.  We invalids think we\\nare privileged people.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\"\\n\\n\"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.  Emma will be happy\\nto entertain you.  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse\\nand take my three turns--my winter walk.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot do better, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,\\nbut I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;\\nand, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I\\nthink the sooner _you_ go the better.  I will fetch your greatcoat\\nand open the garden door for you.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined\\nfor more chat.  He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking\\nof her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\\n\\n\"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\" said he; \"but she is a\\npretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of\\nher disposition.  Her character depends upon those she is with;\\nbut in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said he, \"you are anxious for a compliment, so I will\\ntell you that you have improved her.  You have cured her of her\\nschool-girl\\'s giggle; she really does you credit.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I\\nhad been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow\\npraise where they may.  _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\"\\n\\n\"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Almost every moment.  She has been gone longer already than\\nshe intended.\"\\n\\n\"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\"\\n\\n\"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\"\\n\\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore\\nsaid nothing.  He presently added, with a smile,\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you\\nthat I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon\\nhear of something to her advantage.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! how so? of what sort?\"\\n\\n\"A very serious sort, I assure you;\" still smiling.\\n\\n\"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love\\nwith her? Who makes you their confidant?\"\\n\\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton\\'s having dropt a hint.\\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\\nMr. Elton looked up to him.\\n\\n\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will\\nsoon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\\nquarter:--Robert Martin is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill,\\nthis summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately\\nin love and means to marry her.\"\\n\\n\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet\\nmeans to marry him?\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came\\nto the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.\\nHe knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,\\nI believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask\\nme whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;\\nwhether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his\\nchoice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being\\nconsidered (especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line\\nof society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said.\\nI never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.\\nHe always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very\\nwell judging.  He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,\\nand what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is\\nan excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation\\nin advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it;\\nand that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.\\nI praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.\\nIf he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought\\nhighly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the\\nbest friend and counsellor man ever had.  This happened the night\\nbefore last.  Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should\\nbe at Mrs. Goddard\\'s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,\\nwithout thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\\ndid not speak yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it;\\nbut it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what\\nyou have told me.  He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,\\nand was refused.\"\\n\\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;\\nand Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,\\nas he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,\\n\\n\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.\\nWhat is the foolish girl about?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible\\nto a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.\\nA man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is\\nthe meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,\\nif it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.\"\\n\\n\"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\"\\n\\n\"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.  Emma, this is\\nyour doing.  You persuaded her to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should\\nnot feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable\\nyoung man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet\\'s equal; and am\\nrather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.\\nBy your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.  It is\\na pity that they were ever got over.\"\\n\\n\"Not Harriet\\'s equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;\\nand with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he\\nis not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense\\nas in situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.\\nWhat are Harriet Smith\\'s claims, either of birth, nature or education,\\nto any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural\\ndaughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision\\nat all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only\\nas parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl,\\nnor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful,\\nand is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.\\nAt her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,\\nis not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.\\nShe is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.\\nMy only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being\\nbeneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that,\\nas to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.\\nBut I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing\\nto trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort\\nof disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led\\naright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt\\nto be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)\\nthat there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.\\nEven _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately\\nthat you would not regret your friend\\'s leaving Highbury, for the\\nsake of her being settled so well.  I remember saying to myself,\\n`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a\\ngood match.\\'\"\\n\\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\\nany such thing.  What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying\\na man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I\\nwonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.\\nI assure you mine are very different.  I must think your statement\\nby no means fair.  You are not just to Harriet\\'s claims.\\nThey would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;\\nMr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly\\nher inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves\\nis much above his.--It would be a degradation.\"\\n\\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married\\nto a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\\n\\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense\\nshe may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.\\nShe is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below\\nthe level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely\\nbe a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of\\nfortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged\\nfor her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman\\'s daughter,\\nis indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen\\'s daughters,\\nno one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\\n\\n\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may\\nhave had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part\\nof their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in\\nMrs. Goddard\\'s hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,\\nin Mrs. Goddard\\'s line, to have Mrs. Goddard\\'s acquaintance.\\nHer friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_\\ngood enough.  She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose\\nto turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,\\nnor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the\\nMartins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then.\\nIf she has it now, you have given it.  You have been no friend to\\nHarriet Smith, Emma.  Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far,\\nif he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.\\nI know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any\\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion.  And as to conceit,\\nhe is the farthest from it of any man I know.  Depend upon it he\\nhad encouragement.\"\\n\\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.\\n\\n\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\\nare unjust to Harriet.  Harriet\\'s claims to marry well are not\\nso contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl,\\nbut she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not\\ndeserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.\\nWaiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you\\ndescribe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in\\nthe degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations\\nto the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,\\nand must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;\\nand till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject\\nof beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\\nin love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,\\nwith such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired\\nand sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,\\nconsequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very\\nslight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness\\nof temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great\\nreadiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much mistaken\\nif your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,\\nthe highest claims a woman could possess.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,\\nis almost enough to make me think so too.  Better be without sense,\\nthan misapply it as you do.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully.  \"I know _that_ is the feeling\\nof you all.  I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly\\nwhat every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses\\nand satisfies his judgment.  Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.\\nWere you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.\\nAnd is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning\\nto be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first\\noffer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her.\"\\n\\n\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr. Knightley\\npresently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.\\nYou will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what\\nshe has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her\\nreach will be good enough for her.  Vanity working on a weak head,\\nproduces every sort of mischief.  Nothing so easy as for a young lady\\nto raise her expectations too high.  Miss Harriet Smith may not find\\noffers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.\\nMen of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.\\nMen of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves\\nwith a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be\\nafraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,\\nwhen the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry\\nRobert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;\\nbut if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach\\nher to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence\\nand large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nall the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a\\ngirl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,\\nand is glad to catch at the old writing-master\\'s son.\"\\n\\n\"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,\\nthat there can be no use in canvassing it.  We shall only be making\\neach other more angry.  But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin,\\nit is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,\\nas must prevent any second application.  She must abide by the evil\\nof having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,\\nI will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;\\nbut I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.\\nHis appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,\\nthat if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.\\nI can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,\\nshe might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends,\\nand he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\\nnobody better (that must have been his great assistant)\\nshe might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.\\nBut the case is altered now.  She knows now what gentlemen are;\\nand nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\\nwith Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\" cried Mr. Knightley.--\"Robert\\nMartin\\'s manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend\\nthem; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.\"\\n\\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.\\nShe did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself\\na better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he\\ncould be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment\\nin general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;\\nand to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,\\nwas very disagreeable.  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence,\\nwith only one attempt on Emma\\'s side to talk of the weather,\\nbut he made no answer.  He was thinking.  The result of his thoughts\\nappeared at last in these words.\\n\\n\"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I\\nhope it will not be long before he does.  Your views for Harriet\\nare best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love\\nof match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,\\nand projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you\\nthat if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.\"\\n\\nEmma laughed and disclaimed.  He continued,\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do.  Elton is a very good sort of man,\\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely\\nto make an imprudent match.  He knows the value of a good income\\nas well as any body.  Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will\\nact rationally.  He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you\\ncan be with Harriet\\'s. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,\\nand a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way\\nof talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,\\nI am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.\\nI have heard him speak with great animation of a large family\\nof young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all\\ntwenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again.\\n\"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton\\'s marrying Harriet, it would\\nhave been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want\\nto keep Harriet to myself.  I have done with match-making indeed.\\nI could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.  I shall leave\\noff while I am well.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.\\nHe was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man,\\nand was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the\\nsanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had\\ntaken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.\\n\\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of her\\'s, than in his.  She did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversary\\'s wrong, as Mr. Knightley.\\nHe walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.\\nShe was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little\\ntime and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.\\nHarriet\\'s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.\\nThe possibility of the young man\\'s coming to Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nthat morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,\\ngave alarming ideas.  The dread of such a failure after all became the\\nprominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,\\nand without having any such reason to give for her long absence,\\nshe felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,\\nand convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,\\nshe had done nothing which woman\\'s friendship and woman\\'s feelings\\nwould not justify.\\n\\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,\\nneither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,\\nin spite of Mr. Knightley\\'s pretensions) with the skill of such\\nan observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it\\nhastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather\\nsaid what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew\\nany thing about.  He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak\\nwith more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not\\nbe of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;\\nhe might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;\\nbut then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence\\nof a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley\\nsaw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;\\nbut she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\\nhesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;\\nand more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very\\nsure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\\n\\nHarriet\\'s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,\\nnot to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash\\nhad been telling her something, which she repeated immediately\\nwith great delight.  Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard\\'s to attend\\na sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,\\nthat as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met\\nMr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was\\nactually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till\\nthe morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been\\nnever known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him\\nabout it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,\\nto absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off\\nhis journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been\\ndetermined to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed,\\nthat he was going on business which he would not put off for any\\ninducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,\\nand being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  Mr. Perry\\ncould not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must\\nbe a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only\\nlooked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\\nMiss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more\\nabout Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\\n\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,\\nbut she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,\\nshe should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,\\nMr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel\\nwith herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than\\nusual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,\\nhis grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.  She was sorry,\\nbut could not repent.  On the contrary, her plans and proceedings\\nwere more and more justified and endeared to her by the general\\nappearances of the next few days.\\n\\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after\\nMr. Elton\\'s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\\nof admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet\\'s feelings, they were\\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment\\nas her youth and sort of mind admitted.  Emma was soon perfectly\\nsatisfied of Mr. Martin\\'s being no otherwise remembered, than as\\nhe furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\\n\\nHer views of improving her little friend\\'s mind, by a great deal\\nof useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than\\na few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.\\nIt was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let\\nher imagination range and work at Harriet\\'s fortune, than to be\\nlabouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;\\nand the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,\\nthe only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,\\nwas the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort\\nthat she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,\\nmade up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.\\n\\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale\\nare not uncommon.  Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\\nhad written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken\\nthe first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse\\'s help,\\nto get a great many more.  Emma assisted with her invention,\\nmemory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,\\nit was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form\\nas well as quantity.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,\\nand tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.\\n\"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\"\\nAnd it always ended in \"Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\"\\n\\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;\\nbut he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about\\nso much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.\\n\\nIt was by no means his daughter\\'s wish that the intellects of\\nHighbury in general should be put under requisition.  Mr. Elton\\nwas the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited\\nto contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums\\nthat he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him\\nmost intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,\\nas she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,\\nnothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass\\nhis lips.  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;\\nand the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,\\nand rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,\\n\\n    My first doth affliction denote,\\n      Which my second is destin\\'d to feel\\n    And my whole is the best antidote\\n      That affliction to soften and heal.--\\n\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it\\nsome pages ago already.\\n\\n\"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\" said she;\\n\"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\\neasier to you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind\\nin his life.  The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss\\nWoodhouse\"--he stopt a moment--\"or Miss Smith could inspire him.\"\\n\\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.\\nHe called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the\\ntable containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had\\naddressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,\\nfrom his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\\n\\n\"I do not offer it for Miss Smith\\'s collection,\" said he.\\n\"Being my friend\\'s, I have no right to expose it in any degree\\nto the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\"\\n\\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma\\ncould understand.  There was deep consciousness about him,\\nand he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend\\'s.\\nHe was gone the next moment:--after another moment\\'s pause,\\n\\n\"Take it,\" said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\\nHarriet--\"it is for you.  Take your own.\"\\n\\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,\\nnever loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\\n\\n        To Miss--\\n\\n          CHARADE.\\n\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n    Another view of man, my second brings,\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\n    But ah! united, what reverse we have!\\n      Man\\'s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\\nwhile Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion\\nof hope and dulness, \"Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed.\\nI have read worse charades.  _Courtship_--a very good hint.  I give\\nyou credit for it.  This is feeling your way.  This is saying very\\nplainly--`Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you.\\nApprove my charade and my intentions in the same glance.\\'\\n\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\nHarriet exactly.  Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets,\\nthe justest that could be given.\\n\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\\n\\nHumph--Harriet\\'s ready wit! All the better.  A man must be very much\\nin love, indeed, to describe her so.  Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish\\nyou had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you.\\nFor once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken.\\nAn excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose.\\nThings must come to a crisis soon now.\\n\\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\\neagerness of Harriet\\'s wondering questions.\\n\\n\"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I\\ncannot guess it in the least.  What can it possibly be? Do try\\nto find it out, Miss Woodhouse.  Do help me.  I never saw any thing\\nso hard.  Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could\\nbe the young lady.  Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\\n\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\nCan it be Neptune?\\n\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only\\none syllable.  It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it.\\nOh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\"\\n\\n\"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you\\nthinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made\\nby a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\\n\\nFor Miss ----------, read Miss Smith.\\n\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n\\nThat is _court_.\\n\\n    Another view of man, my second brings;\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nThat is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.\\n\\n    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\\n      Man\\'s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\nA very proper compliment!--and then follows the application,\\nwhich I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty\\nin comprehending.  Read it in comfort to yourself.  There can\\nbe no doubt of its being written for you and to you.\"\\n\\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion.\\nShe read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness.\\nShe could not speak.  But she was not wanted to speak.  It was enough\\nfor her to feel.  Emma spoke for her.\\n\\n\"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,\"\\nsaid she, \"that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton\\'s intentions.\\nYou are his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof\\nof it.  I thought it must be so.  I thought I could not be so deceived;\\nbut now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,\\nas my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you.\\nYes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance\\nto happen what has happened.  I could never tell whether an attachment\\nbetween you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural.\\nIts probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each\\nother! I am very happy.  I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all\\nmy heart.  This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride\\nin creating.  This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.\\nIt will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence,\\na proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,\\nclose to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.\\nThis, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either\\nof us.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Miss Woodhouse!\"--and \"Dear Miss Woodhouse,\" was all that Harriet,\\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they\\ndid arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently\\nclear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered\\njust as she ought.  Mr. Elton\\'s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\\n\\n\"Whatever you say is always right,\" cried Harriet, \"and therefore\\nI suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could\\nnot have imagined it.  It is so much beyond any thing I deserve.\\nMr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions\\nabout _him_.  He is so very superior.  Only think of those sweet\\nverses--`To Miss --------.\\' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really\\nbe meant for me?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that.\\nIt is a certainty.  Receive it on my judgment.  It is a sort\\nof prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon\\nfollowed by matter-of-fact prose.\"\\n\\n\"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected.  I am sure,\\na month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do\\ntake place!\"\\n\\n\"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is\\nso evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement\\nof other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong\\nto one another by every circumstance of your respective homes.\\nYour marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.  There does\\nseem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love\\nexactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel\\nwhere it ought to flow.\\n\\n      The course of true love never did run smooth--\\n\\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.\"\\n\\n\"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,\\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,\\nthe very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body\\nlooks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,\\nthat every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he\\ndoes not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days\\nin the week.  And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down\\nall the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury.\\nDear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little\\ndid I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and\\npeeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss\\nNash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;\\nhowever, she called me back presently, and let me look too,\\nwhich was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!\\nHe was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\"\\n\\n\"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,\\nmust be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;\\nand we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.  If they\\nare anxious to see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable\\ncharacter gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you\\nsettled in the same country and circle which they have chosen\\nto place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only\\nobject is that you should, in the common phrase, be _well_ married,\\nhere is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment,\\nthe rise in the world which must satisfy them.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very true.  How nicely you talk; I love to hear you.\\nYou understand every thing.  You and Mr. Elton are one as clever\\nas the other.  This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,\\nI could never have made any thing like it.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining\\nit yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"\\n\\n\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"\\n\\n\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour.\\nSuch things in general cannot be too short.\"\\n\\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear.  The most satisfactory\\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\\n\\n\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\"to\\nhave very good sense in a common way, like every body else,\\nand if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,\\nand say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write\\nverses and charades like this.\"\\n\\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin\\'s prose.\\n\\n\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet--\"these two last!--But\\nhow shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found\\nit out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?\"\\n\\n\"Leave it to me.  You do nothing.  He will be here this evening,\\nI dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense\\nor other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your\\nsoft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming.  Trust to me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\"\\n\\n\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you\\nshould not write it into your book.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but those two lines are\"--\\n\\n--\"The best of all.  Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\\nenjoyment keep them.  They are not at all the less written you know,\\nbecause you divide them.  The couplet does not cease to be, nor does\\nits meaning change.  But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases,\\nand a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.\\nDepend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,\\nmuch better than his passion.  A poet in love must be encouraged in\\nboth capacities, or neither.  Give me the book, I will write it down,\\nand then there can be no possible reflection on you.\"\\n\\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\\nso as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down\\na declaration of love.  It seemed too precious an offering for any\\ndegree of publicity.\\n\\n\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer\\nit lasts, the better I shall be pleased.  But here is my father\\ncoming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him.\\nIt will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of\\nthe sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment.\\nHe has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must\\nlet me read it to him.\"\\n\\nHarriet looked grave.\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this\\ncharade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are\\ntoo conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,\\nor even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.\\nDo not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.\\nIf he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper\\nwhile I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you.\\nDo not let us be too solemn on the business.  He has encouragement\\nenough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.  Do as you please.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,\\nby the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears,\\nhow does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh.\\nA piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,\\nwe suppose, by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we\\nhave just copied it in.\"\\n\\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,\\nslowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations\\nof every part as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and,\\nas she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\\n\\n\"Aye, that\\'s very just, indeed, that\\'s very properly said.\\nVery true.  `Woman, lovely woman.\\' It is such a pretty charade,\\nmy dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody\\ncould have written so prettily, but you, Emma.\"\\n\\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking,\\nand a very tender sigh, he added,\\n\\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I\\ncan remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you\\nhave heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza;\\nand there are several.\\n\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\\n      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\\n    The hood-wink\\'d boy I called to aid,\\n    Though of his near approach afraid,\\n      So fatal to my suit before.\\n\\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever\\nall the way through.  But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.  We copied it\\nfrom the Elegant Extracts.  It was Garrick\\'s, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.\\n\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\n\\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near\\nbeing christened Catherine after her grandmama.  I hope we shall\\nhave her here next week.  Have you thought, my dear, where you\\nshall put her--and what room there will be for the children?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\nhas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual,\\nyou know.  Why should there be any change?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\\nsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley\\'s\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly\\ntaken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,\\nnot to see Miss Taylor here!\"\\n\\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, my dear.  I am sure I was very much surprized\\nwhen I first heard she was going to be married.\"\\n\\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella\\nis here.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she\\nis coming for only one week.  There will not be time for any thing.\"\\n\\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case\\nof necessity.  Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th,\\nand we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole\\nof the time they can give to the country, that two or three days\\nare not to be taken out for the Abbey.  Mr. Knightley promises\\nto give up his claim this Christmas--though you know it is longer\\nsince they were with him, than with us.\"\\n\\n\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were\\nto be anywhere but at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley\\'s claims on\\nhis brother, or any body\\'s claims on Isabella, except his own.\\nHe sat musing a little while, and then said,\\n\\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back\\nso soon, though he does.  I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade\\nher to stay longer with us.  She and the children might stay very well.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,\\nand I do not think you ever will.  Isabella cannot bear to stay\\nbehind her husband.\"\\n\\nThis was too true for contradiction.  Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits\\naffected by the idea of his daughter\\'s attachment to her husband,\\nshe immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\\n\\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while\\nmy brother and sister are here.  I am sure she will be pleased\\nwith the children.  We are very proud of the children, are not we,\\npapa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will.  Poor little dears, how glad they\\nwill be to come.  They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say they are, sir.  I am sure I do not know who is not.\"\\n\\n\"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.  Henry is the eldest,\\nhe was named after me, not after his father.  John, the second,\\nis named after his father.  Some people are surprized, I believe,\\nthat the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry,\\nwhich I thought very pretty of her.  And he is a very clever boy,\\nindeed.  They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many\\npretty ways.  They will come and stand by my chair, and say,\\n`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?\\' and once Henry asked me\\nfor a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas.\\nI think their father is too rough with them very often.\"\\n\\n\"He appears rough to you,\" said Emma, \"because you are so very\\ngentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas,\\nyou would not think him rough.  He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;\\nand if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;\\nbut he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley\\nis an affectionate father.  The children are all fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling\\nin a very frightful way!\"\\n\\n\"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much.\\nIt is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down\\nthe rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way\\nto the other.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I cannot understand it.\"\\n\\n\"That is the case with us all, papa.  One half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\"\\n\\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\\nin preparation for the regular four o\\'clock dinner, the hero\\nof this inimitable charade walked in again.  Harriet turned away;\\nbut Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye\\nsoon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of\\nhaving thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it\\nmight turn up.  His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s party could be made up in the evening without him,\\nor whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield.\\nIf he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend\\nCole had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made\\nsuch a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.\\n\\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his\\nfriend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber.\\nHe re-urged--she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make\\nhis bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--\\n\\n\"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\\nthank you for the sight of it.  We admired it so much, that I have\\nventured to write it into Miss Smith\\'s collection.  Your friend\\nwill not take it amiss I hope.  Of course I have not transcribed\\nbeyond the first eight lines.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.\\nHe looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about\\n\"honour,\"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book\\nopen on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.\\nWith the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\\n\\n\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\\nmust not be confined to one or two.  He may be sure of every woman\\'s\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\"\\n\\n\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke; \"I have no hesitation in saying--at\\nleast if my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest\\ndoubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it,\\n(looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he\\nwould consider it as the proudest moment of his life.\"\\n\\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible.  Emma could not\\nthink it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities,\\nthere was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt\\nto incline her to laugh.  She ran away to indulge the inclination,\\nleaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet\\'s share.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather\\nto prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;\\nand on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor\\nsick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.\\n\\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode\\nof Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,\\nand then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,\\nan old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it\\ncould be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much\\nsmartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,\\nthere could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without\\na slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma\\'s remark was--\\n\\n\"There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.\"--\\nHarriet\\'s was--\\n\\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow\\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\\n\\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,\\n\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards\\nof this part of Highbury.\"\\n\\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,\\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors\\nand probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,\\nwith Mr. Elton\\'s seeing ready wit in her.\\n\\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think\\nof any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want\\nto inquire about of his housekeeper--no message from my father.\"\\n\\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence\\nof some minutes, Harriet thus began again--\\n\\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,\\nor going to be married! so charming as you are!\"--\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied,\\n\\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\\nI must find other people charming--one other person at least.\\nAnd I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have\\nvery little intention of ever marrying at all.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\\n\\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,\\nto be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)\\nis out of the question:  and I do _not_ wish to see any such person.\\nI would rather not be tempted.  I cannot really change for the better.\\nIf I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"--\\n\\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.\\nWere I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!\\nbut I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;\\nand I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I\\nshould be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I\\ndo not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want:\\nI believe few married women are half as much mistress of their\\nhusband\\'s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect\\nto be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always\\nright in any man\\'s eyes as I am in my father\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\\n\\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--\\nso smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--\\nand so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,\\nI would marry to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never\\ncan be any likeness, except in being unmarried.\"\\n\\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that\\'s so dreadful!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is\\npoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!\\nA single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,\\ndisagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,\\nbut a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,\\nand may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the\\ndistinction is not quite so much against the candour and common\\nsense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income\\nhas a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\\nThose who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,\\nand generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.\\nThis does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good\\nnatured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.\\nPoverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,\\nif she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely\\nto give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a\\ngreat charm.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself\\nwhen you grow old?\"\\n\\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be\\nmore in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.\\nWoman\\'s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then\\nas they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,\\nI shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.\\nAnd as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,\\nwhich is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which\\nis really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall\\nbe very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,\\nto care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability,\\nto supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.\\nThere will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my\\nattachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas\\nof comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews\\nand nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know Miss Bates\\'s niece?  That is, I know you must have\\nseen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes\\nto Highbury.  By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out\\nof conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should\\never bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,\\nas she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name\\nof Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;\\nher compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she\\ndoes but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair\\nof garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.\\nI wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.\"\\n\\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics\\nwere superseded.  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses\\nof the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention\\nand kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.\\nShe understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and\\ntheir temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary\\nvirtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into\\ntheir troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance\\nwith as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance,\\nit was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;\\nand after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,\\nshe quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\\nas made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\\n\\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they\\nmake every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of\\nnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,\\nwho can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" said Harriet.  \"Poor creatures! one can think\\nof nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\"\\nsaid Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep\\nwhich ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,\\nand brought them into the lane again.  \"I do not think it will,\"\\nstopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,\\nand recall the still greater within.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, no,\" said her companion.\\n\\nThey walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend\\nwas passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near\\nas to give Emma time only to say farther,\\n\\n\"Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability\\nin good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that\\nif compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,\\nit has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,\\nenough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,\\nonly distressing to ourselves.\"\\n\\nHarriet could just answer, \"Oh! dear, yes,\" before the gentleman\\njoined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,\\nwere the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call\\non them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very\\ninteresting parley about what could be done and should be done.\\nMr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.\\n\\n\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;\\n\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\\nof love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring\\non the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were\\nanywhere else.\"\\n\\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised\\non one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.\\nBut she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet\\'s\\nhabits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,\\nin short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;\\nshe immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration\\nto make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete\\noccupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,\\nand she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired;\\nand by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,\\nshe had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken\\nby a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,\\nwith her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side\\nof this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural\\nthing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been\\nacting just then without design; and by this means the others were\\nstill able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.\\nShe gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child\\'s pace was quick,\\nand theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,\\nfrom their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.\\nMr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very\\npleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning\\nto think how she might draw back a little more, when they both\\nlooked around, and she was obliged to join them.\\n\\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\\nwas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday\\'s\\nparty at his friend Cole\\'s, and that she was come in herself for\\nthe Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,\\nthe beet-root, and all the dessert.\\n\\n\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love;\\nand any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.\\nIf I could but have kept longer away!\"\\n\\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into\\nthe house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace\\noff short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently\\nobliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to\\nput herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\\n\\n\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am\\nto contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,\\nbut I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg\\nleave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit\\nof ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing\\ncould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\\nhis house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.\\nThe room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,\\nand looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately\\ncommunicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed\\ninto it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most\\ncomfortable manner.  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she\\nfound it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.\\nIt was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging\\nthe housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it\\npracticable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.\\nFor ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could\\nbe protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,\\nand make her appearance.\\n\\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a\\nmost favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory\\nof having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not\\ncome to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;\\nhe had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely\\nfollowed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,\\nbut nothing serious.\\n\\n\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch,\\nand will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\\n\\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished\\nby her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself\\nthat it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,\\nand must be leading them forward to the great event.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself.  It was no longer in Emma\\'s\\npower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.\\nThe coming of her sister\\'s family was so very near at hand,\\nthat first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth\\nher prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay\\nat Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--\\nthat any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could\\nbe afforded by her to the lovers.  They might advance rapidly\\nif they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether\\nthey would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.\\nThere are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will\\ndo for themselves.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual\\nabsent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the\\nusual interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their\\nmarriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;\\nbut all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing\\nfor the children, and it was therefore many months since they had\\nbeen seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all\\nby Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,\\neven for poor Isabella\\'s sake; and who consequently was now most\\nnervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.\\n\\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a\\nlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to\\nbring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms\\nwere needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,\\nand Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent\\nnumber of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.\\nThe bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,\\nwelcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,\\nproduced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne\\nunder any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;\\nbut the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were\\nso respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,\\nand for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,\\nall the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,\\nthe children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,\\neither in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.\\n\\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,\\nand so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for\\nthese higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.\\nShe could never see a fault in any of them.  She was not a woman\\nof strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance\\nof her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;\\nwas delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,\\nhad many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield\\nin town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.  They were alike too,\\nin a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard\\nfor every old acquaintance.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his\\nprivate character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.\\nHe was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross\\nas to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his\\ngreat perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,\\nit was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not\\nbe increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.\\nHe had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,\\nand he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\\n\\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing\\nwrong in him escaped her.  She was quick in feeling the little\\ninjuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.\\nPerhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been\\nflattering to Isabella\\'s sister, but they were only those of a calmly\\nkind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;\\nbut hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her\\nregardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes\\nfell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.\\nThere he had not always the patience that could have been wished.\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking\\nhim to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.\\nIt did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great\\nregard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was\\ndue to him; but it was too often for Emma\\'s charity, especially as\\nthere was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,\\nthough the offence came not.  The beginning, however, of every visit\\ndisplayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity\\nso short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\\nThey had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter\\'s\\nattention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\\n\\n\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must\\nmiss her!  And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--\\nI have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could\\npossibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope\\nshe is pretty well, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know\\nbut that the place agrees with her tolerably.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\\ndoubts of the air of Randalls.\\n\\n\"Oh! no--none in the least.  I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--\\nnever looking so well.  Papa is only speaking his own regret.\"\\n\\n\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.\\n\\n\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella\\nin the plaintive tone which just suited her father.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since\\nthey married.  Either in the morning or evening of every day,\\nexcepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,\\nand generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you\\nmay suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.  They are very,\\nvery kind in their visits.  Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.\\nPapa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving\\nIsabella a false idea of us all.  Every body must be aware that Miss\\nTaylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured\\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any\\nmeans to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.\"\\n\\n\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped\\nit was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could\\nnot be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\\nall easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea\\nof the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;\\nand now you have Emma\\'s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot deny\\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--\\nbut then--she is always obliged to go away again.\"\\n\\n\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--\\nYou quite forget poor Mr. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston\\nhas some little claim.  You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part\\nof the poor husband.  I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,\\nthe claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.\\nAs for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience\\nof putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\\n\\n\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\\n\"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,\\na greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been\\nfor the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought\\nof Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;\\nand as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think\\nthere is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the\\nvery best-tempered men that ever existed.  Excepting yourself\\nand your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.  I shall\\nnever forget his flying Henry\\'s kite for him that very windy day\\nlast Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September\\ntwelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o\\'clock at night,\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,\\nI have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor\\na better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be\\nMiss Taylor.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley.  \"Has he been here\\non this occasion--or has he not?\"\\n\\n\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma.  \"There was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended\\nin nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\\n\\n\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.\\n\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,\\nand a very proper, handsome letter it was.  She shewed it to me.\\nI thought it very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea\\nyou know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"\\n\\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\\n\\n\"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--\\nand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  Well,\\ntime does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.  However, it was\\nan exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston\\na great deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth,\\nand dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,\\' but I forget\\nhow it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.\\'--\\nI remember that perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\\nKnightley.  \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.\\nBut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!\\nThere is something so shocking in a child\\'s being taken away from his\\nparents and natural home!  I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston\\ncould part with him.  To give up one\\'s child!  I really never\\ncould think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\"\\nobserved Mr. John Knightley coolly.  \"But you need not imagine\\nMr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry\\nor John.  Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,\\nthan a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,\\nand makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,\\nmuch more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,\\nupon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his\\nneighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any\\nthing that home affords.\"\\n\\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,\\nand had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let\\nit pass.  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was\\nsomething honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,\\nthe all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother\\'s\\ndisposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,\\nand those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination\\nof Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him\\nin Isabella\\'s first day.  Emma\\'s sense of right however had decided it;\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,\\nshe had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late\\ndisagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him\\nthe proper invitation.\\n\\nShe hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it\\nwas time to make up.  Making-up indeed would not do.  _She_ certainly\\nhad not been in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had.\\nConcession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear\\nto forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather\\nassist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room\\nshe had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl\\nabout eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,\\nand very happy to be danced about in her aunt\\'s arms.  It did assist;\\nfor though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon\\nled on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child\\nout of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.\\nEmma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving\\nher at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,\\nshe could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,\\n\\n\"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\\nAs to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\"\\n\\n\"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men\\nand women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your\\ndealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,\\nwe might always think alike.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being\\nin the wrong.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason good.  I was sixteen years\\nold when you were born.\"\\n\\n\"A material difference then,\" she replied--\"and no doubt you were\\nmuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does\\nnot the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings\\na good deal nearer?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--a good deal _nearer_.\"\\n\\n\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,\\nif we think differently.\"\\n\\n\"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years\\' experience, and by\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.  Come, my dear Emma,\\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it.  Tell your aunt, little Emma,\\nthat she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\\nold grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true,\" she cried--\"very true.  Little Emma, grow up\\na better woman than your aunt.  Be infinitely cleverer and not\\nhalf so conceited.  Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I\\nhave done.  As far as good intentions went, we were _both_ right,\\nand I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet\\nproved wrong.  I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,\\nvery bitterly disappointed.\"\\n\\n\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.\\n\\n\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\"\\n\\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\\nKnightley made his appearance, and \"How d\\'ye do, George?\" and \"John,\\nhow are you?\" succeeded in the true English style, burying under\\na calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment\\nwhich would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing\\nfor the good of the other.\\n\\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined\\ncards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his\\ndear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;\\non one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;\\ntheir subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma\\nonly occasionally joining in one or the other.\\n\\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\\nand who was always the greater talker.  As a magistrate, he had\\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,\\nsome curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand\\nthe home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear\\nnext year, and to give all such local information as could not fail\\nof being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been\\nthe longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.\\nThe plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,\\nand the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,\\nwas entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his\\ncooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever\\nleft him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached\\na tone of eagerness.\\n\\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying\\na full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\\n\\n\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand,\\nand interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one\\nof her five children--\"How long it is, how terribly long since you\\nwere here!  And how tired you must be after your journey!  You must\\ngo to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you\\nbefore you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.\\nMy dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.\"\\n\\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,\\nthat both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article\\nas herself;--and two basins only were ordered.  After a little\\nmore discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its\\nnot being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,\\nwith an air of grave reflection,\\n\\n\"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn\\nat South End instead of coming here.  I never had much opinion\\nof the sea air.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we\\nshould not have gone.  He recommended it for all the children,\\nbut particularly for the weakness in little Bella\\'s throat,--\\nboth sea air and bathing.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her\\nany good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,\\nthough perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very\\nrarely of use to any body.  I am sure it almost killed me once.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \"I must\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea.  It makes me envious and miserable;--\\nI who have never seen it!  South End is prohibited, if you please.\\nMy dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about\\nMr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pretty well; but not quite well.  Poor Perry is bilious,\\nand he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has\\nnot time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is\\nalways wanted all round the country.  I suppose there is not a man\\nin such practice anywhere.  But then there is not so clever a man\\nany where.\"\\n\\n\"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\\nI have a great regard for Mr. Perry.  I hope he will be calling soon.\\nHe will be so pleased to see my little ones.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\\nhim about myself of some consequence.  And, my dear, whenever he comes,\\nyou had better let him look at little Bella\\'s throat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly\\nany uneasiness about it.  Either bathing has been of the greatest\\nservice to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent\\nembrocation of Mr. Wingfield\\'s, which we have been applying\\nat times ever since August.\"\\n\\n\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been\\nof use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,\\nI would have spoken to--\\n\\n\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma,\\n\"I have not heard one inquiry after them.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you\\nmention them in most of your letters.  I hope they are quite well.\\nGood old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take\\nmy children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--\\nAnd that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--\\nHow are they, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.  But poor Mrs. Bates\\nhad a bad cold about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"How sorry I am!  But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn.  Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them\\nmore general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\"\\n\\n\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree\\nyou mention.  Perry says that colds have been very general,\\nbut not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.\\nPerry does not call it altogether a sickly season.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except--\\n\\n\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\\na sickly season.  Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.\\nIt is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--\\nand the air so bad!\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air.  Our part of London is\\nvery superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\\nin general, my dear sir.  The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square\\nis very different from almost all the rest.  We are so very airy!\\nI should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--\\nthere is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my\\nchildren in:  but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks\\nthe vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as\\nto air.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.  You make the best of it--\\nbut after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you\\ndifferent creatures; you do not look like the same.  Now I cannot say,\\nthat I think you are any of you looking well at present.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were\\na little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness\\nof coming.  I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;\\nfor I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe\\nhe had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.  I trust,\\nat least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\"\\nturning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.\\n\\n\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.  I think Mr. John\\nKnightley very far from looking well.\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you\\nlooking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.\\nI could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen\\nMr. Wingfield before you left home.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Isabella,\"--exclaimed he hastily--\"pray do not concern\\nyourself about my looks.  Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\\nyourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\\n\\n\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\\ncried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham\\'s intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate.  What will it answer?\\nWill not the old prejudice be too strong?\"\\n\\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\\nworse to hear than Isabella\\'s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;\\nand Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general,\\nshe was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.\\n\\n\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.--\\n\"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town!  What happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!\\nI always regret excessively on dear Emma\\'s account that she cannot\\nbe more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose\\nColonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.\\nShe would be such a delightful companion for Emma.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\\n\\n\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another\\npretty kind of young person.  You will like Harriet.  Emma could\\nnot have a better companion than Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be\\nso very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma\\'s age.\"\\n\\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of\\nsimilar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening\\ndid not close without a little return of agitation.  The gruel came\\nand supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--\\nundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,\\nand pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was\\nnever met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures\\nwhich the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore\\nmost prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman\\nhired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she\\nmeant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.\\nOften as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able\\nto get any thing tolerable.  Here was a dangerous opening.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\\nher with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma\\'s ear expressed,\\n\"Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to\\nSouth End.  It does not bear talking of.\"  And for a little while\\nshe hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination\\nmight suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel.\\nAfter an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,\\n\\n\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\\ninstead of coming here.\"\\n\\n\"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children\\na great deal of good.\"\\n\\n\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not\\nhave been to South End.  South End is an unhealthy place.\\nPerry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.\"\\n\\n\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is\\nquite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,\\nnever found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield\\nsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;\\nand I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands\\nthe nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been\\nthere repeatedly.\"\\n\\n\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--\\nPerry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best\\nof all the sea-bathing places.  A fine open sea, he says, and very\\npure air.  And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there\\nquite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.\\nYou should have consulted Perry.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\\ngreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much\\nto chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get\\ninto a worse air.  This is just what Perry said.  It seemed to him\\na very ill-judged measure.\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he\\nhad reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\nbrother-in-law\\'s breaking out.\\n\\n\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,\\n\"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for.\\nWhy does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--\\nat my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may\\nbe allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--\\nI want his directions no more than his drugs.\"  He paused--\\nand growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness,\\n\"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children\\na distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense\\nor inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to\\nprefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\"\\n\\n\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\\n\"very true.  That\\'s a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I\\nwas telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning\\nit more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows,\\nI cannot conceive any difficulty.  I should not attempt it,\\nif it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,\\nbut if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . .\\nThe only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps.\\nI shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we\\nwill look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on\\nhis friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously,\\nbeen attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--\\nbut the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed\\nthe present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother,\\nand better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking\\nover what she had done every evening with her father and sister.\\nShe had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass\\nso swiftly.  It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\\n\\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than\\ntheir mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out\\nof the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.\\nMr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls\\none day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible\\nthing in preference to a division of the party.\\n\\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty\\nif he could, but as his son and daughter\\'s carriage and horses\\nwere actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than\\na simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;\\nnor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one\\nof the carriages find room for Harriet also.\\n\\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,\\nwere the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,\\nas well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse\\'s habits and inclination\\nbeing consulted in every thing.\\n\\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event\\nthat Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been\\nspent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed\\nwith a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed\\nby Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.\\nEmma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed\\nwith regard to Randalls.  She was very feverish and had a bad\\nsore throat:  Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry\\nwas talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist\\nthe authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,\\nthough she could not speak of her loss without many tears.\\n\\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\\nMr. Elton\\'s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her\\nat last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having\\na most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.\\nShe had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard\\'s door, when she\\nwas met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as\\nthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--\\nof whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going\\nto inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield--\\nthey were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the\\ndaily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,\\nglowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed\\nto ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they\\nwere hastening home for.  They joined company and proceeded together.\\nEmma was just describing the nature of her friend\\'s complaint;--\\n\"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,\\na quick, low pulse, &c.  and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard\\nthat Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\\nalarmed her with them.\"  Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,\\nas he exclaimed,\\n\\n\"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious.  I hope not of a putrid\\ninfectious sort.  Has Perry seen her?  Indeed you should take care\\nof yourself as well as of your friend.  Let me entreat you to run\\nno risks.  Why does not Perry see her?\"\\n\\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard\\'s experience\\nand care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness\\nwhich she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather\\nfeed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite\\nanother subject,\\n\\n\"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much\\nlike snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,\\nI should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father\\nfrom venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem\\nto feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it\\nwould be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  But, upon\\nmy word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.\\nYou appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider\\nwhat demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,\\nI think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home\\nand take care of yourself to-night.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of\\nher\\'s, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--\\nbut Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions\\nand views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,\\nwas very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its\\nbeing \"very cold, certainly very cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in\\nhaving extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power\\nof sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.\\n\\n\"You do quite right,\" said she;--\"we will make your apologies\\nto Mr. and Mrs. Weston.\"\\n\\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton\\'s\\nonly objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much\\nprompt satisfaction.  It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,\\nand never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than\\nat this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes\\nmore exulting than when he next looked at her.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I\\nhad got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave\\nHarriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,\\nin many men, especially single men, such an inclination--\\nsuch a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in\\nthe class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,\\nalmost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must\\nbe the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young\\nman undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,\\nhe cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.\\nWhat a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,\\nbut will not dine alone for her.\"\\n\\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment\\nin his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his\\nvoice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nfor news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared\\nfor the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be\\nable to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself\\noff in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\\nMr. Elton.  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.\\nWith men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies\\nto please, every feature works.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton\\'s manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook\\na great deal.  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,\\nhe will have the advantage over negligent superiority.  There is\\nsuch perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot\\nbut value.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,\\n\"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining\\nme to be Mr. Elton\\'s object?\"\\n\\n\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\"\\n\\n\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether\\nit is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.\\nI think your manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend,\\nEmma.  You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,\\nand what you mean to do.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.  Mr. Elton\\nand I are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on,\\namusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often\\narise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes\\nwhich people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;\\nand not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind\\nand ignorant, and in want of counsel.  He said no more.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,\\nthat in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea\\nof shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually\\nwith his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent\\nconsciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full\\nof the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at\\nRandalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.\\nThe cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage\\nwas in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,\\nand the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only\\na milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.\\n\\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.\\nThe preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice\\nof his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;\\nand the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in\\nexpressing his discontent.\\n\\n\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when\\nhe asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such\\na day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.  He must think\\nhimself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.\\nIt is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--\\nThe folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the\\nfolly of people\\'s not staying comfortably at home when they can!\\nIf we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of\\nduty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,\\nprobably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward\\nvoluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,\\nwhich tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,\\nto stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--\\nhere are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another\\nman\\'s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses\\nand four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,\\nshivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they\\nmight have had at home.\"\\n\\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt\\nhe was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \"Very true, my love,\"\\nwhich must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;\\nbut she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer\\nat all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;\\nher heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to talk,\\nand arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\nher lips.\\n\\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,\\nand Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.\\nEmma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.  Mr. Elton\\nwas all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful\\nin his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have\\nreceived a different account of Harriet from what had reached her.\\nShe had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, \"Much the same--\\nnot better.\"\\n\\n\"_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\" said she presently, \"was not\\nso pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better\\' was _my_ answer.\"\\n\\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice\\nof sentiment as he answered.\\n\\n\"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard\\'s door, which I did the very last thing\\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\\nby no means better, rather worse.  Very much grieved and concerned--\\nI had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial\\nas I knew had been given her in the morning.\"\\n\\nEmma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part\\nof her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\\nit is a most severe cold indeed.  Mr. Perry has been with her,\\nas you probably heard.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"\\n\\n\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report.  But it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness.  Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\"\\n\\n\"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\"\\n\\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;\\nbut it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay when\\nonly half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\\n\\n\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin\\nfor carriages.  How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to\\nfeel cold with such precautions.  The contrivances of modern days\\nindeed have rendered a gentleman\\'s carriage perfectly complete.\\nOne is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath\\nof air can find its way unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely\\nof no consequence.  It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage\\nwe know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal\\nof it.\"\\n\\n\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton.  \"Quite seasonable;\\nand extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not\\nbegin yesterday, and prevent this day\\'s party, which it might very\\npossibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had\\nthere been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.\\nThis is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.  At Christmas\\nevery body invites their friends about them, and people think little\\nof even the worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend\\'s house once\\nfor a week.  Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night,\\nand could not get away till that very day se\\'nnight.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,\\nbut said only, coolly,\\n\\n\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"\\n\\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too\\nmuch astonished now at Mr. Elton\\'s spirits for other feelings.\\nHarriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\\n\\n\"We are sure of excellent fires,\" continued he, \"and every thing\\nin the greatest comfort.  Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--\\nMrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly\\nwhat one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--\\nit will be a small party, but where small parties are select,\\nthey are perhaps the most agreeable of any.  Mr. Weston\\'s dining-room\\ndoes not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,\\nI would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than\\nexceed by two.  I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft\\nair to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\\nthough Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties\\nof London, may not quite enter into our feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine\\nwith any body.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the\\nlaw had been so great a slavery.  Well, sir, the time must come\\nwhen you will be paid for all this, when you will have little\\nlabour and great enjoyment.\"\\n\\n\"My first enjoyment,\" replied John Knightley, as they passed through\\nthe sweep-gate, \"will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman\\nas they walked into Mrs. Weston\\'s drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must\\ncompose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his\\nill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,\\nto fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,\\nand shew herself just as happy as she was.  To her it was real\\nenjoyment to be with the Westons.  Mr. Weston was a great favourite,\\nand there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with\\nsuch unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related\\nwith such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being\\nalways interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,\\narrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.\\nShe could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not\\na lively concern; and half an hour\\'s uninterrupted communication\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private\\nlife depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\\n\\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day\\'s visit might\\nnot afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;\\nbut the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice\\nwas grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as\\npossible of Mr. Elton\\'s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,\\nand enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.\\n\\nThe misfortune of Harriet\\'s cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival.  Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long\\nenough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own\\nand Isabella\\'s coming, and of Emma\\'s being to follow, and had indeed\\njust got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come\\nand see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston,\\nwho had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,\\nwas able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.\\n\\nEmma\\'s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was\\nclose to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange\\ninsensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat\\nat her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance\\non her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.\\nInstead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could\\nnot avoid the internal suggestion of \"Can it really be as my brother\\nimagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer\\nhis affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\"--\\nYet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be\\nso interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston;\\nand at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal\\nand so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,\\nand made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.\\nFor her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet\\'s, in the hope\\nthat all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;\\nbut it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst\\nthe others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton\\'s nonsense,\\nwhich she particularly wished to listen to.  She heard enough\\nto know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;\\nshe heard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\"\\nrepeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables\\nvery much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from\\nhis son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was\\nso completely past that any reviving question from her would have\\nbeen awkward.\\n\\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma\\'s resolution of never marrying,\\nthere was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,\\nwhich always interested her.  She had frequently thought--especially since\\nhis father\\'s marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she _were_ to marry,\\nhe was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.\\nHe seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.\\nShe could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew\\nthem must think of.  That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was\\nvery strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,\\nor by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more\\nreplete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great\\ncuriosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,\\nof being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure\\nin the idea of their being coupled in their friends\\' imaginations.\\n\\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton\\'s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling\\nvery cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not\\npossibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,\\nor the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--\\nfor when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\\nat dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares\\nof hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,\\nto say to her,\\n\\n\"We want only two more to be just the right number.  I should\\nlike to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,\\nand my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.\\nI believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room\\nthat we are expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning,\\nand he will be with us within a fortnight.\"\\n\\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented\\nto his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making\\ntheir party quite complete.\\n\\n\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston,\\n\"ever since September:  every letter has been full of it;\\nbut he cannot command his own time.  He has those to please\\nwho must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes\\nto be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.  But now\\nI have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.\"\\n\\n\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston\\nis so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost\\nas happy as yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another\\nput-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do:\\nbut she does not know the parties so well as I do.  The case,\\nyou see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:  I did not mention\\na syllable of it in the other room.  There are secrets in all families,\\nyou know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay\\na visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank\\'s coming depends upon\\ntheir being put off.  If they are not put off, he cannot stir.\\nBut I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,\\nof some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:\\nand though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or\\nthree years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\\nI have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as confident\\nof seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am\\nof being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding\\ntowards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,\\nand has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot\\ncalculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice\\nof doing.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\"\\nreplied Emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.  If you\\nthink he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been\\nat the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow\\nmyself to speak ill of her, on Frank\\'s account; for I do believe\\nher to be very fond of him.  I used to think she was not capable\\nof being fond of any body, except herself:  but she has always been\\nkind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,\\nand expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit,\\nin my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;\\nfor, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more\\nheart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.\"\\n\\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--\\nyet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very\\nglad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting\\nat the time talked of:  \"for I cannot depend upon his coming.\\nI cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.  I am very much afraid\\nthat it will all end in nothing.  Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been\\ntelling you exactly how the matter stands?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour\\nof Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain\\nthing in the world.\"\\n\\n\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty\\nof caprice?\"  Then turning to Isabella, who had not been\\nattending before--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,\\nthat we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,\\nin my opinion, as his father thinks.  It depends entirely upon\\nhis aunt\\'s spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.\\nTo you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.\\nMrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;\\nand his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\"\\nreplied Isabella:  \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young\\nman without the greatest compassion.  To be constantly living\\nwith an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.  It is what we\\nhappily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life\\nof misery.  What a blessing, that she never had any children!\\nPoor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\"\\n\\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.  She should then have\\nheard more:  Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\\nfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.\\nBut at present there was nothing more to be said.  Mr. Woodhouse\\nvery soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting\\nlong after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.\\nNeither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did\\nhe move to those with whom he was always comfortable.\\n\\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity\\nof saying,\\n\\n\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any\\nmeans certain.  I am sorry for it.  The introduction must be unpleasant,\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.\\nEven if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still\\nafraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.\\nI cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure\\nthere is a great wish on the Churchills\\' to keep him to themselves.\\nThere is jealousy.  They are jealous even of his regard for his father.\\nIn short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston\\nwere less sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"He ought to come,\" said Emma.  \"If he could stay only a couple\\nof days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man\\'s\\nnot having it in his power to do as much as that.  A young _woman_,\\nif she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance\\nfrom those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young\\n_man_\\'s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week\\nwith his father, if he likes it.\"\\n\\n\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,\\nbefore one decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston.\\n\"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the\\nconduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe,\\nI believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:\\n_she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.\"\\n\\n\"But she is so fond of the nephew:  he is so very great a favourite.\\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,\\nto whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,\\nto whom she owes nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,\\nto understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:  you must\\nlet it go its own way.  I have no doubt of his having, at times,\\nconsiderable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him\\nto know beforehand _when_ it will be.\"\\n\\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied,\\nunless he comes.\"\\n\\n\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\"\\ncontinued Mrs. Weston, \"and on others, very little:  and among those,\\non which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be\\nthis very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\\ntea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness\\nof the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.  Mr. Weston was\\nchatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;\\nbut at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.\\nMr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.\\nMrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.  He joined\\nthem immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself\\nbetween them.\\n\\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind\\nby the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget\\nhis late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before,\\nand on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen\\nwith most friendly smiles.\\n\\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--\\nher fair, lovely, amiable friend.  \"Did she know?--had she\\nheard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?--\\nhe felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her\\ncomplaint alarmed him considerably.\"  And in this style he talked\\non for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,\\nbut altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat;\\nand Emma was quite in charity with him.\\n\\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,\\nthan on Harriet\\'s--more anxious that she should escape the infection,\\nthan that there should be no infection in the complaint.  He began\\nwith great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting\\nthe sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_\\n_him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry\\nand learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off\\nand bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no\\nputting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.  She was vexed.\\nIt did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence\\nof being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy,\\nif real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty\\nin behaving with temper.  He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore\\nher assistance, \"Would not she give him her support?--would not she\\nadd her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\\nto Mrs. Goddard\\'s till it were certain that Miss Smith\\'s disorder\\nhad no infection?  He could not be satisfied without a promise--\\nwould not she give him her influence in procuring it?\"\\n\\n\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless\\nfor herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,\\nand yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated\\nsore throat herself.  Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us.\\nHave not I some right to complain?  I am sure of your kind support\\nand aid.\"\\n\\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston\\'s surprize, and felt that it must be great,\\nat an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself\\nthe right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was\\ntoo much provoked and offended to have the power of directly\\nsaying any thing to the purpose.  She could only give him a look;\\nbut it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses,\\nand then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving\\nher all her attention.\\n\\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly\\ndid another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came\\ninto the room from examining the weather, and opened on them\\nall with the information of the ground being covered with snow,\\nand of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;\\nconcluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:\\n\\n\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\\nsir.  Something new for your coachman and horses to be making\\ntheir way through a storm of snow.\"\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  Mrs. Weston\\nand Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention\\nfrom his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\\n\\n\"I admired your resolution very much, sir,\" said he, \"in venturing\\nout in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow\\nvery soon.  Every body must have seen the snow coming on.\\nI admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.\\nAnother hour or two\\'s snow can hardly make the road impassable;\\nand we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part\\nof the common field there will be the other at hand.  I dare say we\\nshall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,\\nlest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse\\nfor his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen\\nor likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;\\nhe was afraid they would find no difficulty.  He wished the road might\\nbe impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls;\\nand with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might\\nbe found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him,\\nthat with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,\\nwhich she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there\\nbeing but two spare rooms in the house.\\n\\n\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\"\\nwas Mr. Woodhouse\\'s first exclamation, and all that he could say\\nfor some time.  To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances\\nof safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses,\\nand of James, and of their having so many friends about them,\\nrevived him a little.\\n\\nHis eldest daughter\\'s alarm was equal to his own.  The horror of\\nbeing blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,\\nwas full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just\\npassable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,\\nshe was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain\\nat Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through\\nall the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\\n\\n\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she;\\n\"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;\\nand if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.\\nI am not at all afraid.  I should not mind walking half the way.\\nI could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not\\nthe sort of thing that gives me cold.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" replied he.  \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every\\nthing does give you cold.  Walk home!--you are prettily shod\\nfor walking home, I dare say.  It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\\n\\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.\\nMrs. Weston could only approve.  Isabella then went to Emma;\\nbut Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being\\nall able to get away; and they were still discussing the point,\\nwhen Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his\\nbrother\\'s first report of the snow, came back again, and told them\\nthat he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there\\nnot being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they\\nliked it, either now or an hour hence.  He had gone beyond the sweep--\\nsome way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half\\nan inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground;\\na very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting,\\nand there was every appearance of its being soon over.  He had seen\\nthe coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing\\nto apprehend.\\n\\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they\\nwere scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father\\'s account,\\nwho was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not\\nbe appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued\\nat Randalls.  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:  thus--\\n\\n\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\\n\\n\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, do.\"\\n\\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.  A few\\nminutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion\\ndeposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other\\nrecover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.\\n\\nThe carriage came:  and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on\\nsuch occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley\\nand Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some\\nrenewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,\\nand the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.\\n\"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.  He was afraid\\npoor Isabella would not like it.  And there would be poor Emma\\nin the carriage behind.  He did not know what they had best do.\\nThey must keep as much together as they could;\" and James was talked to,\\nand given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.\\n\\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\\nand that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.  It would not have been\\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked\\nto him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have\\nseemed but one.  But now, she would rather it had not happened.\\nShe believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston\\'s good wine,\\nand felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.\\n\\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity\\nof the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\\nfound her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded,\\nand Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:  availing himself\\nof the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already\\nwell known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him;\\nbut flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled\\nlove and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect,\\nand in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon\\nas possible.  It really was so.  Without scruple--without apology--\\nwithout much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,\\nwas professing himself _her_ lover.  She tried to stop him; but vainly;\\nhe would go on, and say it all.  Angry as she was, the thought of\\nthe moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.\\nShe felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore\\ncould hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.\\nAccordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she\\nhoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,\\n\\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.  This to _me_! you forget yourself--\\nyou take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\\nbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!\"--\\nAnd he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.  Command yourself\\nenough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,\\nnot at all to confuse his intellects.  He perfectly knew his own meaning;\\nand having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,\\nand slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--\\nbut acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned\\nat all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very\\nurgent for a favourable answer.\\n\\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy\\nand presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,\\n\\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made\\nyourself too clear.  Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond\\nany thing I can express.  After such behaviour, as I have witnessed\\nduring the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I\\nhave been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me\\nin this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed,\\nwhich I had not supposed possible!  Believe me, sir, I am far,\\nvery far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.\"\\n\\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--\\nMiss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course\\nof my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:\\nnever cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.\\nIf she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her,\\nand I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse\\nis near!  No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.\\nI have thought only of you.  I protest against having paid the smallest\\nattention to any one else.  Every thing that I have said or done,\\nfor many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my\\nadoration of yourself.  You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.\\nNo!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen\\nand understood me.\"\\n\\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--\\nwhich of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.  She was\\ntoo completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:\\nand two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton\\'s\\nsanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he\\njoyously exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.\\nIt confesses that you have long understood me.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing.  So far from\\nhaving long understood you, I have been in a most complete error\\nwith respect to your views, till this moment.  As to myself, I am\\nvery sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--\\nNothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my\\nfriend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me\\ngreat pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:\\nbut had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,\\nI should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits\\nso frequent.  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend\\nyourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought\\nseriously of her?\"\\n\\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn:  \"never, I assure you.\\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort\\nof girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.\\nI wish her extremely well:  and, no doubt, there are men who might not\\nobject to--Every body has their level:  but as for myself, I am not,\\nI think, quite so much at a loss.  I need not so totally despair\\nof an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--\\nNo, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only;\\nand the encouragement I received--\"\\n\\n\"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\\nmistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer\\nof my friend.  In no other light could you have been more to me than\\na common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that\\nthe mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued,\\nMiss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views;\\nnot being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very\\ngreat inequality which you are so sensible of.  But, as it is,\\nthe disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.\\nI have no thoughts of matrimony at present.\"\\n\\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided\\nto invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,\\nand mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few\\nminutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them\\nto a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have\\nbeen desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left\\nno room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.  Without knowing\\nwhen the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,\\nthey found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;\\nand he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it\\nindispensable to wish him a good night.  The compliment was just returned,\\ncoldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,\\nshe was then conveyed to Hartfield.\\n\\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,\\nwho had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from\\nVicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--\\nand in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it\\nseemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:\\nfor Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all\\nkindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort\\nof her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin\\nof gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;\\nand the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\\nexcept herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;\\nand it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\\nthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\\nand be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow\\nof every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\\nthing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\\nof all.  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort\\nor other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;\\nand she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--\\nmore in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was,\\ncould the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\\n\\n\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have\\nborne any thing.  He might have doubled his presumption to me--\\nbut poor Harriet!\"\\n\\nHow she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he\\nhad never thought seriously of Harriet--never!  She looked back\\nas well as she could; but it was all confusion.  She had taken\\nup the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.\\nHis manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious,\\nor she could not have been so misled.\\n\\nThe picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--\\nand the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--\\nhow clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet.  To be sure,\\nthe charade, with its \"ready wit\"--but then the \"soft eyes\"--\\nin fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.\\nWho could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?\\n\\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners\\nto herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,\\nas a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof\\namong others that he had not always lived in the best society,\\nthat with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance\\nwas sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,\\nfor an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect\\nto her as Harriet\\'s friend.\\n\\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on\\nthe subject, for the first start of its possibility.  There was\\nno denying that those brothers had penetration.  She remembered\\nwhat Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution\\nhe had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would\\nnever marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer\\na knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she\\nhad reached herself.  It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton\\nwas proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she\\nhad meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full\\nof his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.\\n\\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton\\'s wanting\\nto pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion.\\nHis professions and his proposals did him no service.  She thought\\nnothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.\\nHe wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his\\neyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy\\nas to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.\\nThere had been no real affection either in his language or manners.\\nSighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\\nhardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\\nless allied with real love.  She need not trouble herself to pity him.\\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite\\nso easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss\\nSomebody else with twenty, or with ten.\\n\\nBut--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as\\naware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),\\nto marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion\\nor mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the\\ngradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,\\nas to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!--\\nIt was most provoking.\\n\\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he\\nwas her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.\\nThe very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;\\nbut he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly\\nhis superior.  He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled\\nfor several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch\\nof a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.\\nThe landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,\\nbeing but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all\\nthe rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources,\\nwas such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself,\\nin every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long\\nheld a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\\nMr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way\\nas he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing\\nto recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.--\\nBut he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must\\nhave been his dependence; and after raving a little about the\\nseeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head,\\nEmma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own\\nbehaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of\\ncourtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived)\\nmight warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy,\\nlike Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.  If _she_\\nhad so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder\\nthat _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.\\n\\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door.  It was foolish,\\nit was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two\\npeople together.  It was adventuring too far, assuming too much,\\nmaking light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought\\nto be simple.  She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved\\nto do such things no more.\\n\\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being\\nvery much attached to this man.  She might never have thought of him\\nbut for me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope,\\nif I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest\\nand humble as I used to think him.  Oh! that I had been satisfied with\\npersuading her not to accept young Martin.  There I was quite right.\\nThat was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left\\nthe rest to time and chance.  I was introducing her into good company,\\nand giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having;\\nI ought not to have attempted more.  But now, poor girl, her peace\\nis cut up for some time.  I have been but half a friend to her;\\nand if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much, I am\\nsure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable\\nfor her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--\\na pert young lawyer.\"\\n\\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed\\na more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been,\\nand might be, and must be.  The distressing explanation she had\\nto make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering,\\nwith the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of\\ncontinuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,\\nconcealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy\\nher in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went\\nto bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having\\nblundered most dreadfully.\\n\\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma\\'s, though under\\ntemporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail\\nto bring return of spirits.  The youth and cheerfulness of morning\\nare in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the\\ndistress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they\\nwill be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.\\n\\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had\\ngone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,\\nand to depend on getting tolerably out of it.\\n\\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really\\nin love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking\\nto disappoint him--that Harriet\\'s nature should not be of that\\nsuperior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--\\nand that there could be no necessity for any body\\'s knowing\\nwhat had passed except the three principals, and especially\\nfor her father\\'s being given a moment\\'s uneasiness about it.\\n\\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal\\nof snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was\\nwelcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder\\nat present.\\n\\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day,\\nshe could not go to church.  Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable\\nhad his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from\\neither exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.\\nThe ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled\\nstate between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most\\nunfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow,\\nand every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most\\nhonourable prisoner.  No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note;\\nno church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no\\nneed to find excuses for Mr. Elton\\'s absenting himself.\\n\\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;\\nand though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort\\nin some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father\\nso well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,\\ntoo wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no\\nweather could keep entirely from them,--\\n\\n\"Ah!  Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\\n\\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly\\nsuited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance\\nto his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off\\nhis ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him\\nduring the rest of his stay at Hartfield.  He was always agreeable\\nand obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.  But with all\\nthe hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay,\\nthere was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation\\nwith Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.\\nThe weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;\\nand Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter\\nto stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole\\nparty set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny\\nof poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with\\nthose she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults,\\nand always innocently busy, might have been a model of right\\nfeminine happiness.\\n\\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note\\nfrom Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,\\nto say, with Mr. Elton\\'s best compliments, \"that he was proposing\\nto leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;\\nwhere, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,\\nhe had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted\\nthe impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of\\nweather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse,\\nof whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense--\\nand had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them.\"\\n\\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton\\'s absence just\\nat this time was the very thing to be desired.  She admired\\nhim for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit\\nfor the manner in which it was announced.  Resentment could not\\nhave been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father,\\nfrom which she was so pointedly excluded.  She had not even a\\nshare in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;--\\nand there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,\\nas she thought, at first, could not escape her father\\'s suspicion.\\n\\nIt did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize\\nof so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get\\nsafely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.\\nIt was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter\\nfor thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.\\nMr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits\\nto persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.\\n\\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.  She had\\nreason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was\\ndesirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting\\nthe better of her other complaint before the gentleman\\'s return.\\nShe went to Mrs. Goddard\\'s accordingly the very next day, to undergo\\nthe necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--\\nShe had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously\\nfeeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--\\nand acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her\\nideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions,\\nall her prophecies for the last six weeks.\\n\\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight\\nof Harriet\\'s tears made her think that she should never be in charity\\nwith herself again.\\n\\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--\\nand in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition\\nand lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular\\nadvantage at that moment to her friend.\\n\\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,\\nseemed on Harriet\\'s side, not her own.  Harriet did not consider\\nherself as having any thing to complain of.  The affection of such\\na man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--\\nShe never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial\\nand kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.\\n\\nHer tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless,\\nthat no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma\\'s eyes--\\nand she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart\\nand understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was\\nthe superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would\\nbe more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or\\nintelligence could do.\\n\\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded\\nand ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution\\nconfirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination\\nall the rest of her life.  Her second duty now, inferior only to her\\nfather\\'s claims, was to promote Harriet\\'s comfort, and endeavour\\nto prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.\\nShe got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness,\\nstriving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation,\\nto drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.\\n\\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she\\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,\\nand very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton\\nin particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet\\'s age,\\nand with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be\\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton\\'s return,\\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,\\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.\\n\\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,\\nprove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;\\nbut yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive\\nagainst an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not\\ncomprehend its continuing very long in equal force.\\n\\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident\\nand indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,\\nshe could not imagine Harriet\\'s persisting to place her happiness\\nin the sight or the recollection of him.\\n\\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad\\nfor each, for all three.  Not one of them had the power of removal,\\nor of effecting any material change of society.  They must encounter\\neach other, and make the best of it.\\n\\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at\\nMrs. Goddard\\'s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers\\nand great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only\\nthat she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling\\nmoderation or repellent truth.  Where the wound had been given,\\nthere must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that,\\ntill she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace\\nfor herself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come.  When the time proposed\\ndrew near, Mrs. Weston\\'s fears were justified in the arrival\\nof a letter of excuse.  For the present, he could not be spared,\\nto his \"very great mortification and regret; but still he looked\\nforward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed,\\nin fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the\\nyoung man had been so much more sober:  but a sanguine temper,\\nthough for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not\\nalways pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.\\nIt soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.\\nFor half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he\\nbegan to perceive that Frank\\'s coming two or three months later\\nwould be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;\\nand that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably\\nlonger with them than if he had come sooner.\\n\\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston,\\nof a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition\\nof excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband\\nwas to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\\n\\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really\\nabout Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s not coming, except as a disappointment\\nat Randalls.  The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.\\nShe wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it\\nwas desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,\\nshe took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,\\nand enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston\\'s disappointment,\\nas might naturally belong to their friendship.\\n\\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed\\nquite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps\\nrather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.\\nShe then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the\\nadvantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry;\\nthe pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,\\nwhich the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections\\non the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a\\ndisagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement,\\nperceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her\\nreal opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston\\'s arguments against herself.\\n\\n\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\ncoolly; \"but I dare say he might come if he would.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know why you should say so.  He wishes exceedingly to come;\\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made\\na point of it.  It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\"\\n\\n\"How odd you are!  What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?\"\\n\\n\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care\\nvery little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with\\nthose who have always set him the example of it.  It is a great deal\\nmore natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up\\nby those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud,\\nluxurious, and selfish too.  If Frank Churchill had wanted to see\\nhis father, he would have contrived it between September and January.\\nA man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be\\nwithout the means of doing as much as that.  It is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always\\nbeen your own master.  You are the worst judge in the world,\\nMr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.  You do not know\\nwhat it is to have tempers to manage.\"\\n\\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.  He cannot\\nwant money--he cannot want leisure.  We know, on the contrary,\\nthat he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at\\nthe idlest haunts in the kingdom.  We hear of him for ever at some\\nwatering-place or other.  A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.\\nThis proves that he can leave the Churchills.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\\n\\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while;\\nwhenever there is any temptation of pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body\\'s conduct, without an\\nintimate knowledge of their situation.  Nobody, who has not been\\nin the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties\\nof any individual of that family may be.  We ought to be\\nacquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill\\'s temper,\\nbefore we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do.\\nHe may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.\"\\n\\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,\\nand that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour\\nand resolution.  It is Frank Churchill\\'s duty to pay this attention\\nto his father.  He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages;\\nbut if he wished to do it, it might be done.  A man who felt rightly\\nwould say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--\\n`Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make\\nto your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately.\\nI know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him\\non the present occasion.  I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.\\'--\\nIf he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming\\na man, there would be no opposition made to his going.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again.  Such language for a young man entirely dependent,\\nto use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible.\\nBut you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly\\nopposite to your own.  Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such\\na speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up,\\nand are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room,\\nI suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine\\nsuch conduct practicable?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made,\\nof course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--\\nwould do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger\\nwith the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts\\nand expedients can ever do.  Respect would be added to affection.\\nThey would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had\\ndone rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know,\\nas well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he\\nought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting\\ntheir power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better\\nof him for submitting to their whims.  Respect for right conduct\\nis felt by every body.  If he would act in this sort of manner,\\non principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend\\nto his.\"\\n\\n\"I rather doubt that.  You are very fond of bending little minds;\\nbut where little minds belong to rich people in authority,\\nI think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as\\nunmanageable as great ones.  I can imagine, that if you, as you are,\\nMr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in\\nMr. Frank Churchill\\'s situation, you would be able to say and do\\njust what you have been recommending for him; and it might have\\na very good effect.  The Churchills might not have a word to say\\nin return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience\\nand long observance to break through.  To him who has, it might\\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence,\\nand set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.\\nHe may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,\\nwithout being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up\\nto it.\"\\n\\n\"Then it would not be so strong a sense.  If it failed to produce\\nequal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the difference of situation and habit!  I wish you would try\\nto understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel\\nin directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been\\nlooking up to all his life.\"\\n\\n\"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against\\nthe will of others.  It ought to have been a habit with him by\\nthis time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.\\nI can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.\\nAs he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off\\nall that was unworthy in their authority.  He ought to have opposed\\nthe first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.\\nHad he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is\\nnothing extraordinary.  I have not the least idea of his being\\na weak young man:  I feel sure that he is not.  Mr. Weston would\\nnot be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely\\nto have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit\\nyour notions of man\\'s perfection.  I dare say he has; and though\\nit may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,\\nand of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself\\nextremely expert in finding excuses for it.  He can sit down and\\nwrite a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods,\\nand persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method\\nin the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father\\'s\\nhaving any right to complain.  His letters disgust me.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings are singular.  They seem to satisfy every body else.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston.  They hardly can\\nsatisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings:  standing in\\na mother\\'s place, but without a mother\\'s affection to blind her.\\nIt is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,\\nand she must doubly feel the omission.  Had she been a person\\nof consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would\\nnot have signified whether he did or no.  Can you think your friend\\nbehindhand in these sort of considerations?  Do you suppose she\\ndoes not often say all this to herself?  No, Emma, your amiable\\nyoung man can be amiable only in French, not in English.  He may be\\nvery `aimable,\\' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he\\ncan have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:\\nnothing really amiable about him.\"\\n\\n\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\\n\\n\"Me!--not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do\\nnot want to think ill of him.  I should be as ready to acknowledge\\nhis merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are\\nmerely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\\nplausible manners.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a\\ntreasure at Highbury.  We do not often look upon fine young men,\\nwell-bred and agreeable.  We must not be nice and ask for all\\nthe virtues into the bargain.  Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,\\nwhat a _sensation_ his coming will produce?  There will be but one subject\\nthroughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--\\none object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;\\nwe shall think and speak of nobody else.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only\\na chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste\\nof every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being\\nuniversally agreeable.  To you, he will talk of farming; to me,\\nof drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general\\ninformation on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,\\nor take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak\\nextremely well on each; that is my idea of him.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!\\nWhat! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--\\nthe practised politician, who is to read every body\\'s character,\\nand make every body\\'s talents conduce to the display of his\\nown superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he\\nmay make all appear like fools compared with himself!  My dear Emma,\\nyour own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came\\nto the point.\"\\n\\n\"I will say no more about him,\" cried Emma, \"you turn every\\nthing to evil.  We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him;\\nand we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here.\"\\n\\n\"Prejudiced!  I am not prejudiced.\"\\n\\n\"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it.\\nMy love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in\\nhis favour.\"\\n\\n\"He is a person I never think of from one month\\'s end to another,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma\\nimmediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend\\nwhy he should be angry.\\n\\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be\\nof a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real\\nliberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;\\nfor with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid\\nto his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could\\nmake him unjust to the merit of another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME II\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,\\nin Emma\\'s opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.\\nShe could not think that Harriet\\'s solace or her own sins required more;\\nand she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject\\nas they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she\\nhad succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must\\nsuffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--\\n\"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!\" she found something else must be done.\\n\\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.\\nThere was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered\\nby the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her,\\nas rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she\\nought to the stock of their scanty comforts.\\n\\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\\nas to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\nof its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--\\nand all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate\\nand third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,\\nand therefore she seldom went near them.  But now she made the sudden\\nresolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,\\nas she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,\\nthey were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\\n\\nThe house belonged to people in business.  Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\\nwhich was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially\\nand even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her\\nknitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up\\nher place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter,\\nalmost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for\\ntheir visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s health, cheerful communications about her mother\\'s,\\nand sweet-cake from the beaufet--\"Mrs. Cole had just been there,\\njust called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an\\nhour with them, and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind\\nas to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss\\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.\"\\n\\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from\\nMr. Elton since his going away.  Emma knew what was coming; they must\\nhave the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone,\\nand how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he\\nwas wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies\\'\\nball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the\\ninterest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always\\nputting forward to prevent Harriet\\'s being obliged to say a word.\\n\\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house;\\nbut meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther\\nincommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst\\nall the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.\\nShe had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;\\nbut he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away\\nfrom him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from\\nher niece.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--\\nMrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--\\nMrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;\\nfor as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her,\\nJane is so very great a favourite there.  Whenever she is with us,\\nMrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough;\\nand I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.\\nAnd so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you\\ncannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\\nfor writing;\\' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have,\\nwe had a letter this very morning,\\' I do not know that I ever saw\\nany body more surprized.  `Have you, upon your honour?\\' said she;\\n`well, that is quite unexpected.  Do let me hear what she says.\\'\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\\n\\n\"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?  I am extremely happy.\\nI hope she is well?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  You are so kind!\" replied the happily deceived aunt,\\nwhile eagerly hunting for the letter.--\"Oh! here it is.  I was sure\\nit could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,\\nwithout being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand\\nso very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.\\nI was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was\\nreading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--\\na letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;\\nso I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under\\nmy huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what\\nshe says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,\\napologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see--\\nhardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.\\nMy mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\\nShe often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty,\\nnow I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work\\'--\\ndon\\'t you, ma\\'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive\\nto make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--\\nevery word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had\\nmade out every word.  And, indeed, though my mother\\'s eyes are not\\nso good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!\\nwith the help of spectacles.  It is such a blessing!  My mother\\'s\\nare really very good indeed.  Jane often says, when she is here,\\n`I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see\\nas you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish\\nmy eyes may last me as well.\\'\"\\n\\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\\nFairfax\\'s handwriting.\\n\\n\"You are extremely kind,\" replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;\\n\"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.\\nI am sure there is nobody\\'s praise that could give us so much pleasure\\nas Miss Woodhouse\\'s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf\\nyou know.  Ma\\'am,\" addressing her, \"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse\\nis so obliging to say about Jane\\'s handwriting?\"\\n\\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment\\nrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.\\nShe was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming\\nvery rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax\\'s letter, and had\\nalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,\\nwhen Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.\\n\\n\"My mother\\'s deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.\\nBy only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.  But it is very\\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\\nJane speaks so distinct!  However, she will not find her grandmama\\nat all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great\\ndeal at my mother\\'s time of life--and it really is full two years,\\nyou know, since she was here.  We never were so long without seeing\\nher before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know\\nhow to make enough of her now.\"\\n\\n\"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; next week.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  You are very kind.  Yes, next week.  Every body is\\nso surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.  I am\\nsure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they\\ncan be to see her.  Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,\\nbecause Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one\\nof those days.  So very good of them to send her the whole way!\\nBut they always do, you know.  Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.\\nThat is what she writes about.  That is the reason of her writing out\\nof rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have\\nheard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, so I imagined.  I was afraid there could be little chance\\nof my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\"\\n\\n\"So obliging of you!  No, we should not have heard, if it had not\\nbeen for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here\\nso soon.  My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months\\nwith us at least.  Three months, she says so, positively, as I\\nam going to have the pleasure of reading to you.  The case is,\\nyou see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.  Mrs. Dixon has\\npersuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.\\nThey had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so\\nimpatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,\\nshe was never away from them so much as a week, which must make\\nit very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\\nbut however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\\nto her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was,\\nbut we shall see presently in Jane\\'s letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon\\'s\\nname as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\\nand they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back\\nto their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.\\nJane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--\\nI do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;\\nbut it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak\\nof his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used\\nto be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell\\nwere very particular about their daughter\\'s not walking out\\noften with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them;\\nof course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell\\nabout his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he\\nhad taken himself.  He is a most amiable, charming young man,\\nI believe.  Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account\\nof things.\"\\n\\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering\\nEmma\\'s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon,\\nand the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design\\nof farther discovery,\\n\\n\"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed\\nto come to you at such a time.  Considering the very particular\\nfriendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected\\nher to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true, indeed.  The very thing that we have always\\nbeen rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her\\nat such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come\\nif any thing was to happen.  But you see, every thing turns out\\nfor the best.  They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to\\ncome over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;\\nnothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation,\\nJane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the\\nleast backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man.\\nEver since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were\\nout in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling\\nround of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed\\ninto the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,\\nwith the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\\n(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we\\nhad the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\"\\n\\n\"But, in spite of all her friends\\' urgency, and her own wish\\nof seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you\\nand Mrs. Bates?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they\\nshould recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try\\nher native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\"\\n\\n\"I am concerned to hear of it.  I think they judge wisely.\\nBut Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed.  Mrs. Dixon,\\nI understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not,\\nby any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no.  You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\\nThere is no comparison between them.  Miss Campbell always was\\nabsolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that of course.\"\\n\\n\"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th\\nof November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been\\nwell since.  A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?\\nShe never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.\\nJust like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well,\\nthat her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,\\nand try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt\\nthat three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--\\nand it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here,\\nthan go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we\\nshould do.\"\\n\\n\"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\"\\n\\n\"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the\\nCampbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--\\nas you will find from Jane\\'s letter.  So sudden!--You may guess,\\ndear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!\\nIf it was not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid\\nwe must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly.\\nI must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.\\nI always make a point of reading Jane\\'s letters through to myself first,\\nbefore I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there\\nbeing any thing in them to distress her.  Jane desired me to do it,\\nso I always do:  and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\\nburst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!\\'--\\nwhich my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly\\nalarmed at.  However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad\\nas I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her,\\nthat she does not think much about it.  But I cannot imagine\\nhow I could be so off my guard.  If Jane does not get well soon,\\nwe will call in Mr. Perry.  The expense shall not be thought of;\\nand though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say\\nhe would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not\\nsuffer it to be so, you know.  He has a wife and family to maintain,\\nand is not to be giving away his time.  Well, now I have just given you\\na hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am\\nsure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it\\nfor her.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid we must be running away,\" said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\\nand beginning to rise--\"My father will be expecting us.\\nI had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than\\nfive minutes, when I first entered the house.  I merely called,\\nbecause I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates;\\nbut I have been so pleasantly detained!  Now, however, we must wish\\nyou and Mrs. Bates good morning.\"\\n\\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.\\nShe regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been\\nforced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard\\nthe whole substance of Jane Fairfax\\'s letter, she had been able\\nto escape the letter itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates\\'s\\nyoungest daughter.\\n\\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry,\\nand Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,\\nhope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking\\nunder consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\\n\\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old,\\non losing her mother, she became the property, the charge,\\nthe consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;\\nof her being taught only what very limited means could command,\\nand growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,\\nto be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,\\ngood understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\\n\\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave\\na change to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had\\nvery highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most\\ndeserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for\\nsuch attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved\\nhis life.  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,\\nthough some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,\\nbefore his own return to England put any thing in his power.\\nWhen he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.\\nHe was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,\\nabout Jane\\'s age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits\\nand growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,\\nhis daughter\\'s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being\\na real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell\\nof undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It was accepted;\\nand from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell\\'s family,\\nand had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother\\nfrom time to time.\\n\\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;\\nthe very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father\\nmaking independence impossible.  To provide for her otherwise\\nwas out of Colonel Campbell\\'s power; for though his income, by pay\\nand appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must\\nbe all his daughter\\'s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped\\nto be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\\n\\nSuch was Jane Fairfax\\'s history.  She had fallen into good hands,\\nknown nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given\\nan excellent education.  Living constantly with right-minded\\nand well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received\\nevery advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell\\'s\\nresidence being in London, every lighter talent had been done\\nfull justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.\\nHer disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that\\nfriendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far\\nas such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she\\nwas too much beloved to be parted with.  Neither father nor mother\\ncould promote, and the daughter could not endure it.  The evil day\\nwas put off.  It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all\\nthe rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious\\nmixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future,\\nthe sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind\\nher that all this might soon be over.\\n\\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\\nCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party\\nfrom the circumstance of Jane\\'s decided superiority both in beauty\\nand acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not\\nbe unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind\\nbe unfelt by the parents.  They continued together with unabated\\nregard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,\\nthat luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,\\ngiving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,\\nengaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,\\nalmost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly\\nand happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\\n\\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment\\nhad fixed on for beginning.  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\nshould be the period.  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate,\\nshe had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,\\nand retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,\\nequal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\\n\\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\\na resolution, though their feelings did.  As long as they lived,\\nno exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;\\nand for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;\\nbut this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better\\nbe soon.  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder\\nand wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared\\nher from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must\\nnow be relinquished.  Still, however, affection was glad to catch\\nat any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.\\nShe had never been quite well since the time of their daughter\\'s marriage;\\nand till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,\\nthey must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being\\ncompatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,\\nunder the most favourable circumstances, to require something\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\ntolerable comfort.\\n\\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account\\nto her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some\\ntruths not told.  It was her own choice to give the time of their\\nabsence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect\\nliberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:\\nand the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,\\nwhether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement\\ntheir ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few\\nmonths spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,\\nthan on any thing else.  Certain it was that she was to come;\\nand that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\nhad been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for\\nthe present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness\\nof a two years\\' absence.\\n\\nEmma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did\\nnot like through three long months!--to be always doing more than\\nshe wished, and less than she ought!  Why she did not like Jane\\nFairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley\\nhad once told her it was because she saw in her the really\\naccomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;\\nand though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,\\nthere were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could\\nnot quite acquit her.  But \"she could never get acquainted with her:\\nshe did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--\\nsuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,\\nher aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss\\nwith by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were\\nto be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had\\nsupposed they must be so fond of each other.\"  These were her reasons--\\nshe had no better.\\n\\nIt was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;\\nand now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years\\'\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance\\nand manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had\\nherself the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty,\\njust such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could\\nthink very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most\\nbecoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance\\nof ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.\\nEmma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--\\nthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;\\nit was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes,\\na deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied\\ntheir praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,\\nas wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\\nno fuller bloom.  It was a style of beauty, of which elegance\\nwas the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,\\nby all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person\\nor of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar,\\nwas distinction, and merit.\\n\\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax\\nwith twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense\\nof rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike\\nher no longer.  When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,\\nas well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance\\nwas destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going\\nto live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion\\nand respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling\\nher to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance\\nof an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started\\nto herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable\\nor more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\\nMr. Dixon\\'s actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous\\nwhich her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love,\\nit might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.\\nShe might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,\\nwhile a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,\\nthe purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit\\nto Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from\\nhim and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.\\n\\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;\\nnobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.\\n\\nThese were charming feelings--but not lasting.  Before she had\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\nJane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices\\nand errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome;\\nshe is better than handsome!\"  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield\\nwith her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much\\ninto its usual state.  Former provocations reappeared.  The aunt\\nwas as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her\\nhealth was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to\\nlisten to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\\nshe ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,\\nas well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her\\nmother and herself; and Jane\\'s offences rose again.  They had music;\\nEmma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily\\nfollowed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air\\nof greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\nsuperior performance.  She was, besides, which was the worst of all,\\nso cold, so cautious!  There was no getting at her real opinion.\\nWrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined\\nto hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\\n\\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more\\nreserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.\\nShe seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon\\'s character,\\nor her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness\\nof the match.  It was all general approbation and smoothness;\\nnothing delineated or distinguished.  It did her no service however.\\nHer caution was thrown away.  Emma saw its artifice, and returned\\nto her first surmises.  There probably _was_ something more to conceal\\nthan her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near\\nchanging one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell,\\nfor the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\\n\\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics.  She and Mr. Frank Churchill\\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time.  It was known that they were\\na little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was.  \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She believed\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.\"  \"Was he agreeable?\"--\\n\"He was generally thought so.\"  \"Did he appear a sensible young man;\\na young man of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common\\nLondon acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.\\nManners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer\\nknowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.  She believed\\nevery body found his manners pleasing.\"  Emma could not forgive her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,\\nhe was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on\\nbusiness with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so\\nopenly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,\\nbut speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.\\nHe had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great\\npleasure in marking an improvement.\\n\\n\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse\\nhad been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,\\nand the papers swept away;--\"particularly pleasant.  You and Miss\\nFairfax gave us some very good music.  I do not know a more\\nluxurious state, sir, than sitting at one\\'s ease to be entertained\\na whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music\\nand sometimes with conversation.  I am sure Miss Fairfax must\\nhave found the evening pleasant, Emma.  You left nothing undone.\\nI was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\\nat her grandmother\\'s, it must have been a real indulgence.\"\\n\\n\"I am happy you approved,\" said Emma, smiling; \"but I hope I am\\nnot often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you\\nare not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.\\nIf any thing, you are too attentive.  The muffin last night--if it\\nhad been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \"you are not\\noften deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.\\nI think you understand me, therefore.\"\\n\\nAn arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough;\" but she\\nsaid only, \"Miss Fairfax is reserved.\"\\n\\n\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome\\nall that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that\\nhas its foundation in diffidence.  What arises from discretion\\nmust be honoured.\"\\n\\n\"You think her diffident.  I do not see it.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he, moving from his chair into one close\\nby her, \"you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you\\nhad not a pleasant evening.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\\nand amused to think how little information I obtained.\"\\n\\n\"I am disappointed,\" was his only answer.\\n\\n\"I hope every body had a pleasant evening,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nin his quiet way.  \"I had.  Once, I felt the fire rather too much;\\nbut then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did\\nnot disturb me.  Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,\\nas she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.  However,\\nshe is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.\\nI like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of\\nyoung lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.\\nShe must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she\\nhad Emma.\"\\n\\n\"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\"\\n\\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for\\nthe present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--\\n\\n\"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one\\'s eyes from.\\nI am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared\\nto express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwhose thoughts were on the Bates\\'s, said--\\n\\n\"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!\\na great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one\\ncan venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--\\nNow we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them\\na loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is\\nnot like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma,\\nunless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried,\\nas ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,\\nfor no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--\\ndo not you think so, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, my dear, very right.  I had not thought of it before,\\nbut that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,\\nif it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,\\njust as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a\\nboiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider\\nit unwholesome.\"\\n\\n\"Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley presently, \"I have a piece of news for you.\\nYou like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think\\nwill interest you.\"\\n\\n\"News!  Oh! yes, I always like news.  What is it?--why do you\\nsmile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\"\\n\\nHe had time only to say,\\n\\n\"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\" when the door\\nwas thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.\\nFull of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to\\ngive quickest.  Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,\\nand that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?  My dear Miss Woodhouse--\\nI come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!\\nYou are too bountiful!  Have you heard the news?  Mr. Elton is going\\nto be married.\"\\n\\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was\\nso completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,\\nand a little blush, at the sound.\\n\\n\"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction\\nof some part of what had passed between them.\\n\\n\"But where could _you_ hear it?\" cried Miss Bates.  \"Where could\\nyou possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?  For it is not five minutes\\nsince I received Mrs. Cole\\'s note--no, it cannot be more than five--\\nor at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready\\nto come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about\\nthe pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--\\nfor my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan\\nlarge enough.  So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said,\\n`Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold,\\nand Patty has been washing the kitchen.\\'--`Oh! my dear,\\'\\nsaid I--well, and just then came the note.  A Miss Hawkins--\\nthat\\'s all I know.  A Miss Hawkins of Bath.  But, Mr. Knightley,\\nhow could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole\\ntold Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.  A Miss Hawkins--\"\\n\\n\"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.\\nHe had just read Elton\\'s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it\\nto me directly.\"\\n\\n\"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\\ngenerally interesting.  My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.\\nMy mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a\\nthousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\"\\n\\n\"We consider our Hartfield pork,\" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it\\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\\ncannot have a greater pleasure than--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\\nto us.  If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\\nWe may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.\\'\\nWell, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\"\\n\\n\"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.\"--\\nHere was a sly glance at Emma.  \"He had been so fortunate as to--\\nI forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.\\nThe information was, as you state, that he was going to be married\\nto a Miss Hawkins.  By his style, I should imagine it just settled.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton going to be married!\" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\\n\"He will have every body\\'s wishes for his happiness.\"\\n\\n\"He is very young to settle,\" was Mr. Woodhouse\\'s observation.\\n\"He had better not be in a hurry.  He seemed to me very well off\\nas he was.  We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.\"\\n\\n\"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\" said Miss Bates,\\njoyfully; \"my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot\\nbear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.\\nThis is great news, indeed.  Jane, you have never seen\\nMr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly\\nto occupy her.\\n\\n\"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\" she replied, starting on this appeal;\\n\"is he--is he a tall man?\"\\n\\n\"Who shall answer that question?\" cried Emma.  \"My father would\\nsay `yes,\\' Mr. Knightley `no;\\' and Miss Bates and I that he is\\njust the happy medium.  When you have been here a little longer,\\nMiss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard\\nof perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.  He is the very best\\nyoung man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday\\nhe was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.  Miss Hawkins,--I dare say,\\nan excellent young woman.  His extreme attention to my mother--\\nwanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better,\\nfor my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she\\ndoes not hear quite quick.  Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a\\nlittle deaf.  He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--\\nbut she says it did him no lasting benefit.  Colonel Campbell,\\nyou know, is quite our angel.  And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming\\nyoung man, quite worthy of him.  It is such a happiness when good\\npeople get together--and they always do.  Now, here will be Mr. Elton\\nand Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;\\nand the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple\\nthan Mr. and Mrs. Perry.  I say, sir,\" turning to Mr. Woodhouse,\\n\"I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\nI always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir,\\nif there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--\\na roast loin of pork--\"\\n\\n\"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been\\nacquainted with her,\" said Emma, \"nothing I suppose can be known.\\nOne feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.  He has been\\ngone only four weeks.\"\\n\\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\\nEmma said,\\n\\n\"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take\\nan interest in this news.  You, who have been hearing and seeing\\nso much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep\\nin the business on Miss Campbell\\'s account--we shall not excuse\\nyour being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.\"\\n\\n\"When I have seen Mr. Elton,\" replied Jane, \"I dare say I\\nshall be interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me.\\nAnd as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression\\nmay be a little worn off.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,\"\\nsaid Miss Bates, \"four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts;\\nnot that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said,\\n`No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but\\'--In short, I do\\nnot think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries.\\nI do not pretend to it.  What is before me, I see.  At the same time,\\nnobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse\\nlets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\\noffend for the world.  How does Miss Smith do?  She seems quite\\nrecovered now.  Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?\\nOh! those dear little children.  Jane, do you know I always fancy\\nMr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.  I mean in person--tall, and with\\nthat sort of look--and not very talkative.\"\\n\\n\"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\"\\n\\n\"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it.  Mr. Dixon, you say,\\nis not, strictly speaking, handsome?\"\\n\\n\"Handsome!  Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.  I told you he\\nwas plain.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\\nand that you yourself--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.  Where I have a regard,\\nI always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed\\nthe general opinion, when I called him plain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.\\nThe weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.\\nYou are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must\\ntake leave.  This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed.\\nI shall just go round by Mrs. Cole\\'s; but I shall not stop three minutes:\\nand, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you\\nout in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already.\\nThank you, we do indeed.  I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,\\nfor I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork:\\nwhen we dress the leg it will be another thing.  Good morning to you,\\nmy dear sir.  Oh!  Mr. Knightley is coming too.  Well, that is\\nso very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to\\ngive her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning\\nto you.\"\\n\\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him\\nwhile he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--\\nand to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give\\nto her own view of the subject.  It was to herself an amusing\\nand a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton\\ncould not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet:\\nHarriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving\\nthe first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly\\nfrom others.  It was now about the time that she was likely to call.\\nIf she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning\\nto rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\\ndetaining her at Mrs. Goddard\\'s, and that the intelligence would\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\\n\\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\" which instantly\\nburst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.\\nAs the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater\\nkindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly\\nthrough what she had to tell.  \"She had set out from Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\nhalf an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been\\nafraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might\\nget to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;\\nbut then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman\\nwas making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step\\nin and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\\nhalf a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\\nand she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast\\nas she could, and took shelter at Ford\\'s.\"--Ford\\'s was the principal\\nwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher\\'s shop united;\\nthe shop first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so,\\nthere she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,\\nfull ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--\\nto be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford\\'s--\\nwho should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--\\nDear Miss Woodhouse! only think.  I thought I should have fainted.\\nI did not know what to do.  I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth saw\\nme directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.\\nI am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\\nno notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;\\nand I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\\nI am sure I must have been as white as my gown.  I could not go away\\nyou know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere\\nin the world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last,\\nI fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going\\non with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.\\nI am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking\\nthat he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,\\nMiss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came quite up\\nto me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\\nif I would.  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used;\\nI could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be\\nvery friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time;\\nbut I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember\\nshe said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost\\ntoo kind!  Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!\\nBy that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined\\nthat nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--\\nI found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as\\nif he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,\\nand I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,\\nyou know, one can\\'t tell how; and then I took courage, and said it\\ndid not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\\nthree yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,\\nif I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round\\nby Mr. Cole\\'s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated\\nby this rain.  Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!\\nSo I said, I was very much obliged to him:  you know I could\\nnot do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round\\nby the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,\\nor any thing about it.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done\\nany thing than have it happen:  and yet, you know, there was a sort\\nof satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.\\nAnd Elizabeth, too.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make\\nme comfortable again.\"\\n\\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\\nher power.  She was obliged to stop and think.  She was not thoroughly\\ncomfortable herself.  The young man\\'s conduct, and his sister\\'s,\\nseemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.\\nAs Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture\\nof wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.\\nBut she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before;\\nand what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?\\nIt was folly to be disturbed by it.  Of course, he must be sorry\\nto lose her--they must be all sorry.  Ambition, as well as love,\\nhad probably been mortified.  They might all have hoped to rise\\nby Harriet\\'s acquaintance:  and besides, what was the value of\\nHarriet\\'s description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--\\nwhat signified her praise?\\n\\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable,\\nby considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite\\nunworthy of being dwelt on,\\n\\n\"It might be distressing, for the moment,\" said she; \"but you seem\\nto have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--\\ncan never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need\\nnot think about it.\"\\n\\nHarriet said, \"very true,\" and she \"would not think about it;\"\\nbut still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;\\nand Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head,\\nwas obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give\\nwith so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether\\nto rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state\\nof mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton\\'s importance\\nwith her!\\n\\nMr. Elton\\'s rights, however, gradually revived.  Though she did not\\nfeel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before,\\nor an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their\\nfirst conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the\\nsensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure,\\nas to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place\\nthe Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.\\n\\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.\\nIt had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining\\nany influence to alarm.  As Harriet now lived, the Martins could\\nnot get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted\\neither the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her\\nrefusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard\\'s;\\nand a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again,\\nwith any necessity, or even any power of speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in\\ninteresting situations, that a young person, who either marries\\nor dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.\\n\\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins\\'s name was first\\nmentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other,\\ndiscovered to have every recommendation of person and mind;\\nto be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable:\\nand when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects,\\nand circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more\\nfor him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose\\nmusic she principally played.\\n\\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man.  He had gone away rejected\\nand mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series\\nof what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing\\nthe right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very\\nwrong one.  He had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged\\nto another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first,\\nas under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.\\nHe came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing\\nfor Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\\n\\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\\nof perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of\\nsome dignity, as well as some convenience:  the story told well;\\nhe had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l.\\nor thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--\\nthe first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\\ndistinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole\\nof the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps\\nso quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green\\'s,\\nand the party at Mrs. Brown\\'s--smiles and blushes rising in importance--\\nwith consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady\\nhad been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,\\nto use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,\\nthat vanity and prudence were equally contented.\\n\\nHe had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,\\nand was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself\\nand his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be\\nlaughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing\\nall the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,\\nhe would have been more cautiously gallant.\\n\\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves\\nto please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for;\\nand when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation,\\nwhich a certain glance of Mrs. Cole\\'s did not seem to contradict,\\nthat when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\\n\\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her\\nthe impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique\\nand pretension, now spread over his air.  She was, in fact,\\nbeginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing\\nat all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very\\ndisagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance,\\na lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind,\\nshe would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.\\nShe wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare\\ntwenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.\\n\\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly\\nbe lessened by his marriage.  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--\\nmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it.  A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for\\nany change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.\\nIt would be almost beginning their life of civility again.\\n\\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.  She was good\\nenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--\\nhandsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet\\'s side.\\nAs to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,\\nthat after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,\\nhe had done nothing.  On that article, truth seemed attainable.\\n_What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out;\\nand setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at\\nall Harriet\\'s superior.  She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.\\nMiss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--\\nmerchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the\\nprofits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was\\nnot unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\\nmoderate also.  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\\nbut Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though\\nthe father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--\\nin the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded\\nof him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter\\nhad lived.  Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,\\nand too stupid to rise.  And all the grandeur of the connexion\\nseemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_,\\nto a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!\\nThat was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of\\nMiss Hawkins.\\n\\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!\\nShe had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be\\ntalked out of it.  The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies\\nof Harriet\\'s mind was not to be talked away.  He might be superseded\\nby another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer;\\neven a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,\\nshe feared, would cure her.  Harriet was one of those, who,\\nhaving once begun, would be always in love.  And now, poor girl!\\nshe was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.\\nShe was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.  Emma saw\\nhim only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure\\n_just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him, _just_ to hear his voice,\\nor see his shoulder, _just_ to have something occur to preserve him\\nin her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.\\nShe was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when\\nat Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,\\nand found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;\\nand every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already\\noccurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,\\ncomprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually\\nin agitation around her.  Her regard was receiving strength by\\ninvariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings\\nirritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins\\'s happiness,\\nand continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--\\nhis air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat,\\nbeing all in proof of how much he was in love!\\n\\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain\\nto her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of\\nHarriet\\'s mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.\\nSometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each\\nwas occasionally useful as a check to the other.  Mr. Elton\\'s\\nengagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin.\\nThe unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been\\na little put aside by Elizabeth Martin\\'s calling at Mrs. Goddard\\'s\\na few days afterwards.  Harriet had not been at home; but a note had\\nbeen prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;\\na small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness;\\nand till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied\\nby it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess.  But Mr. Elton,\\nin person, had driven away all such cares.  While he staid,\\nthe Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off\\nfor Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\\njudged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin\\'s visit.\\n\\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--\\nand what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful\\nconsideration.  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,\\nwhen invited to come, would be ingratitude.  It must not be:\\nand yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!--\\n\\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet\\'s\\nreturning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,\\nshould convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.\\nShe meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill,\\nwhile she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon,\\nas to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what\\ndegree of intimacy was chosen for the future.\\n\\nShe could think of nothing better:  and though there was something\\nin it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,\\nmerely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting.  Only half an hour before her\\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard\\'s, her evil stars had led\\nher to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to\\n_The_ _Rev._ _Philip_ _Elton_, _White-Hart_, _Bath_, was to be seen under the\\noperation of being lifted into the butcher\\'s cart, which was to\\nconvey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,\\nexcepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.\\n\\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to\\nbe put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led\\nbetween espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every\\nthing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,\\nwas beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,\\nEmma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity,\\nwhich determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed\\nquarter of an hour.  She went on herself, to give that portion\\nof time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\\n\\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay,\\nand unattended by any alarming young man.  She came solitarily\\ndown the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,\\nand parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\\n\\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.\\nShe was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her\\nenough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it\\nwas creating.  She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.\\nThey had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing\\nbeyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--\\ntill just at last, when Mrs. Martin\\'s saying, all of a sudden,\\nthat she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more\\ninteresting subject, and a warmer manner.  In that very room\\nshe had been measured last September, with her two friends.\\nThere were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by\\nthe window.  _He_ had done it.  They all seemed to remember the day,\\nthe hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,\\nthe same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;\\nand they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma\\nmust suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)\\nwhen the carriage reappeared, and all was over.  The style of\\nthe visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.\\nFourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully\\npassed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture\\nit all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally\\nHarriet must suffer.  It was a bad business.  She would have given\\na great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins\\nin a higher rank of life.  They were so deserving, that a _little_\\nhigher should have been enough:  but as it was, how could she have\\ndone otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.  They must\\nbe separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--\\nso much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity\\nof a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls\\nto procure it.  Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.\\nThe refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\\n\\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard\\nthat neither \"master nor mistress was at home;\" they had both\\nbeen out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\\n\\n\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away.  \"And now we\\nshall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been\\nso disappointed.\"  And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge\\nher murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--\\nsuch being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.\\nPresently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt\\nby Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.\\nThere was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater\\npleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted\\nher with,\\n\\n\"How d\\'ye do?--how d\\'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--\\nglad to see him so well.  Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter\\nthis morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--\\nhe is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would\\nbe so.  If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days;\\nI was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going\\nto have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.\\nWe shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly\\nas we could wish.\"\\n\\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston\\'s, confirmed as it all\\nwas by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,\\nbut not less to the purpose.  To know that _she_ thought his coming\\ncertain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did\\nshe rejoice in their joy.  It was a most delightful reanimation\\nof exhausted spirits.  The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness\\nof what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment\\'s thought,\\nshe hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.\\n\\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,\\nwhich allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at\\nhis command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;\\nand she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.\\n\\n\"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\" said he, at the conclusion.\\n\\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,\\nfrom his wife.\\n\\n\"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\" said she, \"we are detaining\\nthe girls.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma, \"but you must\\nnot be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\\naccount you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"--\\nthough his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very\\ndifferent conviction.\\n\\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer\\nin a manner that appropriated nothing.\\n\\n\"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o\\'clock,\"\\nwas Mrs. Weston\\'s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,\\nand meant only for her.\\n\\n\"Four o\\'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr. Weston\\'s\\nquick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\\nEmma\\'s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\\na different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish\\nas before.  When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at\\nleast must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet,\\nshe saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\\n\\n\"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\"--\\nwas a question, however, which did not augur much.\\n\\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,\\nand Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come\\nin time.\\n\\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston\\'s\\nfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve\\no\\'clock, that she was to think of her at four.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear anxious friend,\"--said she, in mental soliloquy,\\nwhile walking downstairs from her own room, \"always overcareful\\nfor every body\\'s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your\\nlittle fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure\\nthat all is right.\"  The clock struck twelve as she passed through\\nthe hall.  \"\\'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four\\nhours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later,\\nI may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.\\nI am sure they will bring him soon.\"\\n\\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with\\nher father--Mr. Weston and his son.  They had been arrived only\\na few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation\\nof Frank\\'s being a day before his time, and her father was yet\\nin the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when\\nshe appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\\n\\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,\\nwas actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did\\nnot think too much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good\\nlooking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable,\\nand his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness\\nof his father\\'s; he looked quick and sensible.  She felt immediately\\nthat she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner,\\nand a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending\\nto be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\\n\\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before.  She was pleased\\nwith the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan,\\nand travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half\\na day.\\n\\n\"I told you yesterday,\" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \"I told\\nyou all that he would be here before the time named.  I remembered\\nwhat I used to do myself.  One cannot creep upon a journey;\\none cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the\\npleasure of coming in upon one\\'s friends before the look-out begins,\\nis worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.\"\\n\\n\"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\" said the young man,\\n\"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\"\\n\\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;\\nthe conviction was strengthened by what followed.  He was very much\\npleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,\\nwould hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,\\nthe walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,\\nand professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest\\nin the country which none but one\\'s _own_ country gives, and the\\ngreatest curiosity to visit it.  That he should never have been\\nable to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously\\nthrough Emma\\'s brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a\\npleasant one, and pleasantly handled.  His manner had no air of study\\nor exaggeration.  He did really look and speak as if in a state of no\\ncommon enjoyment.\\n\\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.\\nOn his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--\\nPleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps,\\nafforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses\\nin and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?\"\\n\\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,\\nwhile their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing\\nhis mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,\\nso much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she\\nsecured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,\\nas was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--\\nand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.\\nHe did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be\\nthoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know\\nvery little of the matter.  He understood what would be welcome;\\nhe could be sure of little else.  \"His father\\'s marriage,\" he said,\\n\"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;\\nand the family from whom he had received such a blessing must\\nbe ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation\\non him.\"\\n\\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor\\'s merits,\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse\\'s\\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor\\'s. And at last, as if resolved\\nto qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he\\nwound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.\\n\\n\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he;\\n\"but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected\\nmore than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;\\nI did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\"\\nsaid Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\\nwith pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\\nsuch words.  Don\\'t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as\\na pretty young woman.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it,\\n(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should\\nunderstand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought\\nextravagant in my terms.\"\\n\\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\\nfrom their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession\\nof her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were\\nto be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.\\nShe must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she\\nonly felt they were agreeable.\\n\\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.\\nHis quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them\\nwith a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not\\nto look, she was confident that he was often listening.\\n\\nHer own father\\'s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,\\nthe entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration\\nor suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.  Happily he\\nwas not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--\\nThough always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,\\nhe never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;\\nit seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons\\'\\nunderstanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were\\nproved against them.  She blessed the favouring blindness.\\nHe could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise,\\nwithout a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest,\\ngive way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous\\ninquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s accommodation on his journey,\\nthrough the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express\\nvery genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped\\ncatching cold--which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite\\nassured of himself till after another night.\\n\\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going.\\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\\nfor Mrs. Weston at Ford\\'s, but he need not hurry any body else.\"\\nHis son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the\\nopportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,\\nand therefore may as well be paid now.  I have the honour of being\\nacquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady\\nresiding in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.\\nI shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;\\nthough Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather\\nsay Barnes, or Bates.  Do you know any family of that name?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure we do,\" cried his father; \"Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--\\nI saw Miss Bates at the window.  True, true, you are acquainted\\nwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine\\ngirl she is.  Call upon her, by all means.\"\\n\\n\"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,\" said the\\nyoung man; \"another day would do as well; but there was that degree\\nof acquaintance at Weymouth which--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.  What is right to be done\\ncannot be done too soon.  And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided.\\nYou saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body\\nshe mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,\\nwho has barely enough to live on.  If you do not call early it\\nwill be a slight.\"\\n\\nThe son looked convinced.\\n\\n\"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\" said Emma; \"she is\\na very elegant young woman.\"\\n\\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a \"Yes,\" as inclined her almost\\nto doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct\\nsort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could\\nbe thought only ordinarily gifted with it.\\n\\n\"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\"\\nsaid she, \"I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;\\nsee her and hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,\\nfor she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.\"\\n\\n\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\"\\nsaid Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;\\n\"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very\\nagreeable young lady.  She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama\\nand aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.\\nThey will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my\\nservants shall go with you to shew you the way.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\"\\n\\n\"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses;\\nyou might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you\\nwhere you had best cross the street.\"\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \"My good friend,\\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he\\nsees it, and as to Mrs. Bates\\'s, he may get there from the Crown\\nin a hop, step, and jump.\"\\n\\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,\\nand a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.\\nEmma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,\\nand could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of\\nthe day, with full confidence in their comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.  He came with\\nMrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.\\nHe had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\\ntill her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse\\ntheir walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there\\nbeing very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him,\\nhe should always chuse the same.  Highbury, that airy, cheerful,\\nhappy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction.\"--\\nHighbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to\\nits bearing the same construction with him.  They walked thither directly.\\n\\nEmma had hardly expected them:  for Mr. Weston, who had called in\\nfor half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,\\nknew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize\\nto her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,\\narm in arm.  She was wanting to see him again, and especially\\nto see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom\\nher opinion of him was to depend.  If he were deficient there,\\nnothing should make amends for it.  But on seeing them together,\\nshe became perfectly satisfied.  It was not merely in fine words\\nor hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be\\nmore proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could\\nmore agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and\\nsecuring her affection.  And there was time enough for Emma to form a\\nreasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.\\nThey were all three walking about together for an hour or two--\\nfirst round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.\\nHe was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently\\nfor Mr. Woodhouse\\'s ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,\\nconfessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,\\nand found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma\\ncould have supposed.\\n\\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.\\nHe begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,\\nand which had been the home of his father\\'s father; and on recollecting\\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though\\nin some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit,\\nthey shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general,\\nwhich must be very like a merit to those he was with.\\n\\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,\\nit could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\\nabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making\\na parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly\\nhad not done him justice.\\n\\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,\\nthough the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of\\npost-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood\\nthan from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected\\nto be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they\\ngave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built\\nmany years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been\\nin a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used\\nas such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the\\nhighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist\\nclub established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.\\nHe was immediately interested.  Its character as a ball-room caught him;\\nand instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two\\nsuperior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate\\nits capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should\\nhave ceased.  He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge\\nnone which they suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough,\\nhandsome enough.  It would hold the very number for comfort.\\nThey ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through\\nthe winter.  Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good\\nold days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!\\nThe want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be\\ntempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.\\nHe could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw\\naround him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting;\\nand even when particulars were given and families described, he was\\nstill unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture\\nwould be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty\\nin every body\\'s returning into their proper place the next morning.\\nHe argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma\\nwas rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail\\nso decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have\\nall the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations\\nof his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.\\nOf pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference\\nto a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.\\nHe could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\\nIt was but an effusion of lively spirits.\\n\\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\\nand being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,\\nEmma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him\\nif he had paid it.\\n\\n\"Yes, oh! yes\"--he replied; \"I was just going to mention it.\\nA very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very\\nmuch obliged to you for your preparatory hint.  If the talking aunt\\nhad taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.\\nAs it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.\\nTen minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that\\nwas proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home\\nbefore him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my\\nutter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)\\njoined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them\\nvery nearly three-quarters of an hour.  The good lady had not given me\\nthe possibility of escape before.\"\\n\\n\"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\"\\n\\n\"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill.\\nBut the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\\nLadies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally\\nso pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--\\nA most deplorable want of complexion.\"\\n\\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\\nFairfax\\'s complexion.  \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she\\nwould not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was\\na softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance\\nto the character of her face.\"  He listened with all due deference;\\nacknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he\\nmust confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want\\nof the fine glow of health.  Where features were indifferent,\\na fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,\\nthe effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the\\neffect was.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"there is no disputing about taste.--At least\\nyou admire her except her complexion.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head and laughed.--\"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax\\nand her complexion.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see her often at Weymouth?  Were you often in the same society?\"\\n\\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford\\'s, and he hastily exclaimed,\\n\"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day\\nof their lives, as my father informs me.  He comes to Highbury himself,\\nhe says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford\\'s.\\nIf it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.\\nI must buy something at Ford\\'s. It will be taking out my freedom.--\\nI dare say they sell gloves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.  I do admire your patriotism.\\nYou will be adored in Highbury.  You were very popular before you came,\\nbecause you were Mr. Weston\\'s son--but lay out half a guinea at\\nFord\\'s, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.\"\\n\\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \"Men\\'s Beavers\"\\nand \"York Tan\" were bringing down and displaying on the counter,\\nhe said--\"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking\\nto me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst\\nof my _amor_ _patriae_.  Do not let me lose it.  I assure you the utmost\\nstretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any\\nhappiness in private life.\"\\n\\n\"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax\\nand her party at Weymouth.\"\\n\\n\"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\\nvery unfair one.  It is always the lady\\'s right to decide on the degree\\nof acquaintance.  Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--\\nI shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.\\nBut her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,\\nshe is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least\\ninformation about any body, that I really think you may say what you\\nlike of your acquaintance with her.\"\\n\\n\"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me\\nso well.  I met her frequently at Weymouth.  I had known the Campbells\\na little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\\nwarm-hearted woman.  I like them all.\"\\n\\n\"You know Miss Fairfax\\'s situation in life, I conclude; what she\\nis destined to be?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.\"\\n\\n\"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\" said Mrs. Weston smiling;\\n\"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows\\nwhat to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax\\'s situation in life.\\nI will move a little farther off.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly do forget to think of _her_,\" said Emma, \"as having ever\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\"\\n\\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\\n\\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,\\n\"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\"\\nsaid Frank Churchill.\\n\\n\"Ever hear her!\" repeated Emma.  \"You forget how much she belongs\\nto Highbury.  I have heard her every year of our lives since we\\nboth began.  She plays charmingly.\"\\n\\n\"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\\ncould really judge.  She appeared to me to play well, that is,\\nwith considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--\\nI am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill\\nor right of judging of any body\\'s performance.--I have been used\\nto hear her\\'s admired; and I remember one proof of her being\\nthought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love\\nwith another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--\\nwould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument,\\nif the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed\\nto like to hear one if he could hear the other.  That, I thought,\\nin a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\"\\n\\n\"Proof indeed!\" said Emma, highly amused.--\"Mr. Dixon is very musical,\\nis he?  We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought\\nit a very strong proof.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal\\nstronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all\\nagreeable to me.  I could not excuse a man\\'s having more music\\nthan love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine\\nsounds than to my feelings.  How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\"\\n\\n\"It was her very particular friend, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Poor comfort!\" said Emma, laughing.  \"One would rather have a stranger\\npreferred than one\\'s very particular friend--with a stranger it might\\nnot recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--\\nPoor Mrs. Dixon!  Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\"\\n\\n\"You are right.  It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;\\nbut she really did not seem to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which.\\nBut be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship,\\nor dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have\\nfelt it:  Miss Fairfax herself.  She must have felt the improper\\nand dangerous distinction.\"\\n\\n\"As to that--I do not--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax\\'s\\nsensations from you, or from any body else.  They are known to no\\nhuman being, I guess, but herself.  But if she continued to play\\nwhenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\"\\n\\n\"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--\"\\nhe began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, \"however, it\\nis impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--\\nhow it might all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there\\nwas smoothness outwardly.  But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from\\na child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she\\nis likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.\"\\n\\n\"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\\nand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should\\nbe intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever\\nshe visited her friends.  But we never did.  I hardly know how it\\nhas happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side\\nwhich was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized\\nand so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother,\\nand all their set.  And then, her reserve--I never could attach\\nmyself to any one so completely reserved.\"\\n\\n\"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\" said he.  \"Oftentimes\\nvery convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.  There is safety\\nin reserve, but no attraction.  One cannot love a reserved person.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\\nmay be the greater.  But I must be more in want of a friend,\\nor an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take\\nthe trouble of conquering any body\\'s reserve to procure one.\\nIntimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.\\nI have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that\\nsuch extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,\\nsuch a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt\\nto suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.\"\\n\\nHe perfectly agreed with her:  and after walking together so long,\\nand thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.\\nHe was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the\\nworld in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune,\\ntherefore better than she had expected.  His ideas seemed more moderate--\\nhis feelings warmer.  She was particularly struck by his manner\\nof considering Mr. Elton\\'s house, which, as well as the church,\\nhe would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much\\nfault with.  No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house\\nas a man was to be pitied for having.  If it were to be shared with\\nthe woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having\\nthat house.  There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.\\nThe man must be a blockhead who wanted more.\\n\\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\\nUsed only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could\\nbe no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.\\nBut Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\\nwas talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination\\nto settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.\\nHe might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be\\noccasioned by no housekeeper\\'s room, or a bad butler\\'s pantry,\\nbut no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make\\nhim happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly\\ngive up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nEmma\\'s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken\\nthe following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,\\nmerely to have his hair cut.  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him\\nat breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\\nreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\\nhaving his hair cut.  There was certainly no harm in his travelling\\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air\\nof foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.  It did\\nnot accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense,\\nor even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself\\nto discern in him yesterday.  Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\\nrestlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\\nliable to all these charges.  His father only called him a coxcomb,\\nand thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it,\\nwas clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,\\nand making no other comment than that \"all young people would have\\ntheir little whims.\"\\n\\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.  Mrs. Weston\\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he\\nmade himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.\\nHe appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful\\nand lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,\\na great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard,\\nwas fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the\\nworld if he were left to himself; and though there was no being\\nattached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,\\nand seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.\\nThis was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy\\nfor having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy\\nof the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;\\nthe honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being\\nat least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference--\\n(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short,\\nof being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.\\n\\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\\nhave some weight.  He gave her to understand that Frank admired\\nher extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming;\\nand with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must\\nnot judge him harshly.  As Mrs. Weston observed, \"all young people\\nwould have their little whims.\"\\n\\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\\nleniently disposed.  In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\\nof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances\\nwere made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--\\none who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit\\namong them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows\\nor smiles--Mr. Knightley.  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield;\\nfor the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately\\nafterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,\\n\"Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.\"  She had\\nhalf a mind to resent; but an instant\\'s observation convinced\\nher that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,\\nand not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\\n\\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston\\'s visit this morning was in another respect\\nparticularly opportune.  Something occurred while they were\\nat Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was\\nstill more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.\\n\\nThis was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years\\nin Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,\\nand unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,\\nin trade, and only moderately genteel.  On their first coming into\\nthe country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,\\nkeeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last\\nyear or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--\\nthe house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general\\nhad smiled on them.  With their wealth, their views increased;\\ntheir want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.\\nThey added to their house, to their number of servants,\\nto their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune\\nand style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\\nTheir love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\\nfor their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among\\nthe single men, had already taken place.  The regular and best\\nfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--\\nneither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.  Nothing should\\ntempt _her_ to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father\\'s\\nknown habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she\\ncould wish.  The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they\\nought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms\\non which the superior families would visit them.  This lesson,\\nshe very much feared, they would receive only from herself;\\nshe had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\\n\\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many\\nweeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,\\nit found her very differently affected.  Donwell and Randalls\\nhad received their invitation, and none had come for her father\\nand herself; and Mrs. Weston\\'s accounting for it with \"I suppose\\nthey will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not\\ndine out,\" was not quite sufficient.  She felt that she should\\nlike to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea\\nof the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those\\nwhose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again,\\nshe did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept.\\nHarriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.  They had\\nbeen speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\\nand Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence.\\nMight not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.\\nThe bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;\\nand her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission\\nto be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\\n\\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were\\nat Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\\nfirst remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\"\\nshe so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\\n\\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\\nwithout inclination for the party.  The Coles expressed themselves\\nso properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--\\nso much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the\\nhonour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen\\nfrom London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught\\nof air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\\nhonour of his company.\"  Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;\\nand it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be\\ndone without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,\\nif not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--\\nMr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter\\'s\\ngoing out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending\\nthe whole evening away from him.  As for _his_ going, Emma did\\nnot wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late,\\nand the party too numerous.  He was soon pretty well resigned.\\n\\n\"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\" said he--\"I never was.\\nNo more is Emma.  Late hours do not agree with us.  I am sorry\\nMr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.  I think it would be\\nmuch better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,\\nand take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;\\nwhich they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home\\nwithout being out in the damp of the evening.  The dews of a summer\\nevening are what I would not expose any body to.  However, as they\\nare so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you\\nwill both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,\\nI cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,\\nneither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\"  Then turning to Mrs. Weston,\\nwith a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah!  Miss Taylor, if you had\\nnot married, you would have staid at home with me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away,\\nit is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will\\nstep to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.\"\\n\\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\\nnot lessening, Mr. Woodhouse\\'s agitation.  The ladies knew better\\nhow to allay it.  Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing\\ndeliberately arranged.\\n\\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough\\nfor talking as usual.  \"He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard.\\nHe had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,\\nand invite her.  James could take the note.  But first of all,\\nthere must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.\"\\n\\n\"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.  You will\\nsay that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\\ndecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_,\\nof course.  But you will do every thing right.  I need not tell you\\nwhat is to be done.  We must remember to let James know that the carriage\\nwill be wanted on Tuesday.  I shall have no fears for you with him.\\nWe have never been there above once since the new approach was made;\\nbut still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.\\nAnd when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would\\nhave him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.\\nYou will not like staying late.  You will get very tired when tea\\nis over.\"\\n\\n\"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.  There will be\\na great many people talking at once.  You will not like the noise.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"if Emma comes away early,\\nit will be breaking up the party.\"\\n\\n\"And no great harm if it does,\" said Mr. Woodhouse.  \"The sooner\\nevery party breaks up, the better.\"\\n\\n\"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.\\nEmma\\'s going away directly after tea might be giving offence.\\nThey are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;\\nbut still they must feel that any body\\'s hurrying away is no\\ngreat compliment; and Miss Woodhouse\\'s doing it would be more thought\\nof than any other person\\'s in the room.  You would not wish to disappoint\\nand mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people\\nas ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years.\"\\n\\n\"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged\\nto you for reminding me.  I should be extremely sorry to be giving\\nthem any pain.  I know what worthy people they are.  Perry tells\\nme that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.  You would not think\\nit to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.\\nNo, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.  My dear Emma,\\nwe must consider this.  I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting\\nMr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.\\nYou will not regard being tired.  You will be perfectly safe,\\nyou know, among your friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, papa.  I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have\\nno scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.\\nI am only afraid of your sitting up for me.  I am not afraid\\nof your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.\\nShe loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid\\nyou will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your\\nusual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.\\nYou must promise me not to sit up.\"\\n\\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side:  such as that,\\nif she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;\\nif hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid\\nshould sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see\\nthat every thing were safe in the house, as usual.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father\\'s\\ndinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston\\nwas too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,\\nto betray any imperfection which could be concealed.\\n\\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with\\na very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed\\nof what he had done.  He had no reason to wish his hair longer,\\nto conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,\\nto improve his spirits.  He was quite as undaunted and as lively\\nas ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--\\n\\n\"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things\\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an\\nimpudent way.  Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not\\nalways folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.\\nMr. Knightley, he is _not_ a trifling, silly young man.  If he were,\\nhe would have done this differently.  He would either have gloried\\nin the achievement, or been ashamed of it.  There would have been\\neither the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too\\nweak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he\\nis not trifling or silly.\"\\n\\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,\\nand for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,\\nand by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;\\nof guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness\\ninto her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those\\nmight be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.\\n\\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at\\nMr. Cole\\'s; and without being able to forget that among the failings\\nof Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed\\nher more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\\n\\nHer father\\'s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as\\nMrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty,\\nbefore she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as\\nthey sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly\\nnoticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all\\nthe amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake\\nand full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his\\ncare of their constitution might have obliged them to practise\\nduring the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;\\nshe wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.\\n\\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole\\'s door; and was pleased\\nto see that it was Mr. Knightley\\'s; for Mr. Knightley keeping\\nno horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health,\\nactivity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma\\'s opinion, to get\\nabout as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became\\nthe owner of Donwell Abbey.  She had an opportunity now of speaking\\nher approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\\n\\n\"This is coming as you should do,\" said she; \"like a gentleman.--\\nI am quite glad to see you.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her, observing, \"How lucky that we should arrive at the same\\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--\\nYou might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I should, I am sure I should.  There is always a look of\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know\\nto be beneath them.  You think you carry it off very well, I dare say,\\nbut with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern;\\nI always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.\\n_Now_ you have nothing to try for.  You are not afraid of being\\nsupposed ashamed.  You are not striving to look taller than any\\nbody else.  _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same\\nroom with you.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsensical girl!\" was his reply, but not at all in anger.\\n\\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party\\nas with Mr. Knightley.  She was received with a cordial respect\\nwhich could not but please, and given all the consequence she could\\nwish for.  When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,\\nthe strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;\\nthe son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked\\nher as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated\\nby her--and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity\\non his side.\\n\\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox\\'s family,\\nthe lawyer of Highbury.  The less worthy females were to come\\nin the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith;\\nbut already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject\\nof conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton\\nwere talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to\\nthe pleasantness of her neighbour.  The first remote sound to which\\nshe felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.\\nMrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be\\nvery interesting.  She listened, and found it well worth listening to.\\nThat very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.\\nMrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates,\\nand as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight\\nof a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand,\\nbut a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story,\\nthe end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,\\nand congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates\\'s, was,\\nthat this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood\\'s the day before,\\nto the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;\\nthat at first, by Miss Bates\\'s account, Jane herself was quite at\\na loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--\\nbut now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only\\none quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.\\n\\n\"One can suppose nothing else,\" added Mrs. Cole, \"and I was only\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt.  But Jane,\\nit seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said\\nabout it.  She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their\\nsilence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.\\nThey might chuse to surprize her.\"\\n\\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there\\nwere enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way,\\nand still listen to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\n\"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given\\nme more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,\\nwho plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.\\nIt seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses\\nthere are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.\\nThis is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was\\nbut yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed\\nto look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I\\ndo not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are\\nbut just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;\\nand there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest\\nold spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this\\nto Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he\\nis so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging\\nhimself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might\\nbe so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;\\nand that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--\\nor else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great\\nhopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.\"\\n\\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole\\'s,\\nturned to Frank Churchill.\\n\\n\"Why do you smile?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Nay, why do you?\"\\n\\n\"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell\\'s being\\nso rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\"\\n\\n\"Very.\"\\n\\n\"I rather wonder that it was never made before.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\"\\n\\n\"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--\\nwhich must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\"\\n\\n\"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large\\nfor Mrs. Bates\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies\\nthat your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.  I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\nacuteness than I deserve.  I smile because you smile, and shall probably\\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\\nthere is to question.  If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?\"\\n\\n\"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed.  I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.\\nShe must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument\\nwould be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,\\nis more like a young woman\\'s scheme than an elderly man\\'s. It\\nis Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.  I told you that your suspicions would\\nguide mine.\"\\n\\n\"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon\\nin them.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Dixon.--Very well.  Yes, I immediately perceive that it must\\nbe the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.  We were speaking the\\nother day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I\\nhad entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good\\nintentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help\\nsuspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,\\nhe had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became\\nconscious of a little attachment on her side.  One might guess\\ntwenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure\\nthere must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury\\ninstead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.  Here, she must be\\nleading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been\\nall enjoyment.  As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look\\nupon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed;\\nbut what can any body\\'s native air do for them in the months\\nof January, February, and March?  Good fires and carriages would\\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I\\ndare say in her\\'s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly\\ntell you what they are.\"\\n\\n\"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.\\nMr. Dixon\\'s preference of her music to her friend\\'s, I can answer\\nfor being very decided.\"\\n\\n\"And then, he saved her life.  Did you ever hear of that?--\\nA water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.\\nHe caught her.\"\\n\\n\"He did.  I was there--one of the party.\"\\n\\n\"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,\\nfor it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think\\nI should have made some discoveries.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,\\nthat Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon\\ncaught her.--It was the work of a moment.  And though the consequent\\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I\\nbelieve it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--\\nyet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar\\nanxiety to be observable.  I do not mean to say, however, that you\\nmight not have made discoveries.\"\\n\\nThe conversation was here interrupted.  They were called on to share\\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,\\nand obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when\\nthe table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\\nexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,\\nEmma said,\\n\\n\"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.  I wanted to know\\na little more, and this tells me quite enough.  Depend upon it,\\nwe shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\"\\n\\n\"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we\\nmust conclude it to come from the Campbells.\"\\n\\n\"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.  Miss Fairfax knows it\\nis not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.\\nShe would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.\\nI may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced\\nmyself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.  Your reasonings\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely.  At first, while I\\nsupposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw\\nit only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing\\nin the world.  But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more\\nprobable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.\\nAnd now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.\"\\n\\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther.  The conviction\\nseemed real; he looked as if he felt it.  She said no more,\\nother subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away;\\nthe dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked\\nto and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever\\nthings said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion\\nneither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks,\\ndull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.\\n\\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,\\nin their different divisions, arrived.  Emma watched the entree of her\\nown particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity\\nand grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the\\nartless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,\\nunsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations\\nof pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.\\nThere she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had\\nbeen lately shedding?  To be in company, nicely dressed herself\\nand seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty,\\nand say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.\\nJane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she\\nmight have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad\\nto have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having\\nloved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous\\npleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.\\n\\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much\\nin the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity\\nor interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance;\\nbut by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced,\\nand she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations\\nwere received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \"my\\nexcellent friend Colonel Campbell.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\\nby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask\\nand to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious\\nof that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she\\nplainly read in the fair heroine\\'s countenance.\\n\\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the\\nearly was Frank Churchill.  In he walked, the first and the handsomest;\\nand after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and\\nher niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\\nwhere sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\\nwould not sit at all.  Emma divined what every body present must\\nbe thinking.  She was his object, and every body must perceive it.\\nShe introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient\\nmoments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.  \"He had\\nnever seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.\"\\nAnd she, \"Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,\\nbut she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\"\\nEmma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.\\n\\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--\\nhated sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--\\nthat his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left\\nvery busy over parish business--that as long as he had staid,\\nhowever, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general\\na set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of\\nHighbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--\\nthat Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place\\nrather too much.  She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--\\nthe extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;\\nand could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe\\nwas concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings\\nwere among a range of great families, none very near; and that even\\nwhen days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\\nchance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that,\\nthough he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,\\nwithout considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away,\\nor introduce an acquaintance for a night.\\n\\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,\\ntaken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more\\nretirement at home than he liked.  His importance at Enscombe was\\nvery evident.  He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,\\nthat he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,\\nand on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting\\none or two points) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing.\\nOne of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.\\nHe had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed\\nto be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.  This had\\nhappened the year before.  _Now_, he said, he was beginning to have\\nno longer the same wish.\\n\\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed\\nto be good behaviour to his father.\\n\\n\"I have made a most wretched discovery,\" said he, after a short pause.--\\n\"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.  I never knew\\ndays fly so fast.  A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to\\nenjoy myself.  But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--\\nI hate the recollection.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day,\\nout of so few, in having your hair cut.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, smiling, \"that is no subject of regret at all.\\nI have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself\\nfit to be seen.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\\nWhen Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored\\nas before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room\\nat Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said she.\\n\\nHe started.  \"Thank you for rousing me,\" he replied.  \"I believe\\nI have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair\\nin so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes\\nfrom her.  I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must\\nbe a fancy of her own.  I see nobody else looking like her!--\\nI must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.  Shall I?--\\nYes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;--\\nwhether she colours.\"\\n\\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly\\nin front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\\n\\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\\n\\n\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get\\nnear every body, and say every thing.  My dear Emma, I am longing\\nto talk to you.  I have been making discoveries and forming plans,\\njust like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.\\nDo you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?\"\\n\\n\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?\"\\n\\n\"They walked, I conclude.  How else could they come?\"\\n\\n\"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\\nit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night,\\nand cold as the nights are now.  And as I looked at her, though I\\nnever saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she\\nwas heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.\\nPoor girl!  I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston\\ncame into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about\\nthe carriage.  You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;\\nand having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates,\\nto assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took\\nus home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.\\nGood soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.\\n`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!\\'--but with many,\\nmany thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley\\'s\\ncarriage had brought, and was to take them home again.\\'  I was\\nquite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.\\nSuch a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--\\nthe sort of thing that so few men would think of.  And, in short,\\nfrom knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.\\nI do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself,\\nand that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely.  I know no man\\nmore likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any\\nthing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.\\nHe is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,\\nconsidering Jane Fairfax\\'s ill-health, would appear a case\\nof humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,\\nthere is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.\\nI know he had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at\\nhim about it, but he said not a word that could betray.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for\\nmore simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;\\nfor while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head,\\nand I have never been able to get it out again.  The more I think\\nof it, the more probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match\\nbetween Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.  See the consequence\\nof keeping you company!--What do you say to it?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\" exclaimed Emma.  \"Dear Mrs. Weston,\\nhow could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley\\nmust not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--\\nOh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.  I cannot at all consent to\\nMr. Knightley\\'s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.\\nI am amazed that you should think of such a thing.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.\\nI do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--\\nbut the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley\\nreally wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry\\'s\\naccount, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I would.  I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--\\nMr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I\\ncannot adopt it now.  And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\"\\n\\n\"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you\\nvery well know.\"\\n\\n\"But the imprudence of such a match!\"\\n\\n\"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\"\\n\\n\"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation\\nthan what you mention.  His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,\\nwould be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great\\nregard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--\\nand is always glad to shew them attention.  My dear Mrs. Weston,\\ndo not take to match-making.  You do it very ill.  Jane Fairfax mistress\\nof the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.  For his own sake,\\nI would not have him do so mad a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.  Excepting inequality of fortune,\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\"\\n\\n\"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.  I am sure he has not the\\nleast idea of it.  Do not put it into his head.  Why should he marry?--\\nHe is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,\\nand his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely\\nfond of his brother\\'s children.  He has no occasion to marry,\\neither to fill up his time or his heart.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\\nloves Jane Fairfax--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!  He does not care about Jane Fairfax.  In the way\\nof love, I am sure he does not.  He would do any good to her,\\nor her family; but--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he\\ncould do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\"\\n\\n\"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;\\na very shameful and degrading connexion.  How would he bear to have\\nMiss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey,\\nand thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--\\n`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very\\nkind neighbour!\\'  And then fly off, through half a sentence,\\nto her mother\\'s old petticoat.  `Not that it was such a very old\\npetticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed,\\nshe must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.\\'\"\\n\\n\"For shame, Emma!  Do not mimic her.  You divert me against\\nmy conscience.  And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would\\nbe much disturbed by Miss Bates.  Little things do not irritate him.\\nShe might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would\\nonly talk louder, and drown her voice.  But the question is not,\\nwhether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it;\\nand I think he does.  I have heard him speak, and so must you,\\nso very highly of Jane Fairfax!  The interest he takes in her--\\nhis anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no\\nhappier prospect!  I have heard him express himself so warmly on\\nthose points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,\\nand of her voice!  I have heard him say that he could listen to her\\nfor ever.  Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\\nto me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--\\nthough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present\\nfrom the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?  I cannot\\nhelp suspecting him.  I think he is just the person to do it,\\neven without being in love.\"\\n\\n\"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.\\nBut I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.\\nMr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\\noftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\\ncourse of things, occur to him.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have\\ntold her so.\"\\n\\n\"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.  I have a very\\nstrong notion that it comes from him.  I am sure he was particularly\\nsilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\"\\n\\n\"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\\nmany a time reproached me with doing.  I see no sign of attachment--\\nI believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince\\nme that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\"\\n\\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was\\nthe most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room\\nshewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--\\nand at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse\\nwould do them the honour of trying it.  Frank Churchill, of whom,\\nin the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been\\nseeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax,\\nfollowed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as,\\nin every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very\\nproper compliance.\\n\\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt\\nmore than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste\\nnor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,\\nand could accompany her own voice well.  One accompaniment to her song\\ntook her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly\\ntaken by Frank Churchill.  Her pardon was duly begged at the close\\nof the song, and every thing usual followed.  He was accused\\nof having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;\\nwhich was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,\\nand had no voice at all, roundly asserted.  They sang together\\nonce more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax,\\nwhose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\\nattempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\\n\\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen.  Frank Churchill sang again.\\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.\\nBut the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew\\naway half Emma\\'s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking\\non the subject of Mrs. Weston\\'s suspicions, to which the sweet\\nsounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.\\nHer objections to Mr. Knightley\\'s marrying did not in the least subside.\\nShe could see nothing but evil in it.  It would be a great\\ndisappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.\\nA real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,\\nand material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her\\nfather\\'s daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could not at all\\nendure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.  A Mrs. Knightley\\nfor them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry.\\nLittle Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\\n\\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.\\nThey talked at first only of the performance.  His admiration\\nwas certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,\\nit would not have struck her.  As a sort of touchstone, however,\\nshe began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece;\\nand though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,\\nshe believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any\\nkindness of his own.\\n\\n\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage\\nmore useful on such occasions.  It is not that I am without the wish;\\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that James\\nshould put-to for such a purpose.\"\\n\\n\"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,\" he replied;--\\n\"but you must often wish it, I am sure.\"  And he smiled with such\\nseeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.\\n\\n\"This present from the Campbells,\" said she--\"this pianoforte\\nis very kindly given.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--\\n\"But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.\\nSurprizes are foolish things.  The pleasure is not enhanced, and the\\ninconvenience is often considerable.  I should have expected better\\njudgment in Colonel Campbell.\"\\n\\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley\\nhad had no concern in giving the instrument.  But whether he\\nwere entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there\\nwere no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.\\nTowards the end of Jane\\'s second song, her voice grew thick.\\n\\n\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\\n\"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"\\n\\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for.  \"One more;--they would\\nnot fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for\\none more.\"  And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \"I think you could\\nmanage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.\\nThe strength of the song falls on the second.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\\n\\n\"That fellow,\" said he, indignantly, \"thinks of nothing but shewing\\noff his own voice.  This must not be.\"  And touching Miss Bates,\\nwho at that moment passed near--\"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let\\nyour niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?  Go, and interfere.\\nThey have no mercy on her.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even\\nto be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all\\nfarther singing.  Here ceased the concert part of the evening,\\nfor Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers;\\nbut soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--\\noriginating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted\\nby Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,\\nto give proper space.  Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,\\nwas seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill,\\ncoming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand,\\nand led her up to the top.\\n\\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\\nvoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.\\nThis would be a trial.  He was no dancer in general.  If he were to be\\nvery alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.\\nThere was no immediate appearance.  No; he was talking to Mrs. Cole--\\nhe was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\\nand he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;\\nand she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.\\nNot more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the\\nsuddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well\\nmatched in a partner.  They were a couple worth looking at.\\n\\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.\\nIt was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home,\\non her mother\\'s account.  After some attempts, therefore, to be\\npermitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,\\nlook sorrowful, and have done.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it is as well,\" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma\\nto her carriage.  \"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid\\ndancing would not have agreed with me, after your\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.\\nThe visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day;\\nand all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side\\nof dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour\\nof popularity.  She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people,\\nwho deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would\\nnot soon die away.\\n\\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were\\ntwo points on which she was not quite easy.  She doubted whether\\nshe had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying\\nher suspicions of Jane Fairfax\\'s feelings to Frank Churchill.\\nIt was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it\\nwould escape her, and his submission to all that she told,\\nwas a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult\\nfor her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.\\n\\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;\\nand there she had no doubt.  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally\\nregret the inferiority of her own playing and singing.  She did\\nmost heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat\\ndown and practised vigorously an hour and a half.\\n\\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet\\'s coming in; and if Harriet\\'s\\npraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\\n\\n\"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t class us together, Harriet.  My playing is no more like\\nher\\'s, than a lamp is like sunshine.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two.  I think you play\\nquite as well as she does.  I am sure I had much rather hear you.\\nEvery body last night said how well you played.\"\\n\\n\"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.\\nThe truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\\nbut Jane Fairfax\\'s is much beyond it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,\\nor that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.\\nMr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked\\na great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more\\nthan execution.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?  I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had\\nany taste.  Nobody talked about it.  And I hate Italian singing.--\\nThere is no understanding a word of it.  Besides, if she does play\\nso very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,\\nbecause she will have to teach.  The Coxes were wondering last night\\nwhether she would get into any great family.  How did you think the\\nCoxes looked?\"\\n\\n\"Just as they always do--very vulgar.\"\\n\\n\"They told me something,\" said Harriet rather hesitatingly;\"\\nbut it is nothing of any consequence.\"\\n\\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful\\nof its producing Mr. Elton.\\n\\n\"They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him\\nto stay to dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox.\\nI do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I\\nshould go and stay there again next summer.\"\\n\\n\"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox\\nshould be.\"\\n\\n\"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.  He sat\\nby her at dinner.  Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would\\nbe very glad to marry him.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\\ngirls in Highbury.\"\\n\\nHarriet had business at Ford\\'s.--Emma thought it most prudent to go\\nwith her.  Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible,\\nand in her present state, would be dangerous.\\n\\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--\\nMr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at\\nthe office-door, Mr. Cole\\'s carriage-horses returning from exercise,\\nor a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest\\nobjects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on\\nthe butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from\\nshop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone,\\nand a string of dawdling children round the baker\\'s little bow-window\\neyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,\\nand was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.\\nA mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see\\nnothing that does not answer.\\n\\nShe looked down the Randalls road.  The scene enlarged;\\ntwo persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were\\nwalking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.  They were stopping,\\nhowever, in the first place at Mrs. Bates\\'s; whose house was\\na little nearer Randalls than Ford\\'s; and had all but knocked,\\nwhen Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road\\nand came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday\\'s\\nengagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.\\nMrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,\\nin order to hear the new instrument.\\n\\n\"For my companion tells me,\" said she, \"that I absolutely promised\\nMiss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.  I was\\nnot aware of it myself.  I did not know that I had fixed a day,\\nbut as he says I did, I am going now.\"\\n\\n\"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\"\\nsaid Frank Churchill, \"to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--\\nif you are going home.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\\n\\n\"I thought you meant to go with me.  They would be very much pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Me!  I should be quite in the way.  But, perhaps--I may be equally\\nin the way here.  Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me.\\nMy aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.  She says I fidget\\nher to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say\\nthe same.  What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"I am here on no business of my own,\" said Emma; \"I am only waiting\\nfor my friend.  She will probably have soon done, and then we\\nshall go home.  But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear\\nthe instrument.\"\\n\\n\"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell\\nshould have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove\\nto have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?  I shall be no\\nsupport to Mrs. Weston.  She might do very well by herself.\\nA disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I\\nam the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe any such thing,\" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded\\nthat you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;\\nbut there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.\\nQuite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax\\'s opinion\\nlast night.\"\\n\\n\"Do come with me,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if it be not very disagreeable\\nto you.  It need not detain us long.  We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\\nWe will follow them to Hartfield.  I really wish you to call with me.\\nIt will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you\\nmeant it.\"\\n\\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates\\'s door.  Emma watched them in,\\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon,\\nbe it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.\\nAt last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\\n\\n\"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard\\'s, ma\\'am?\" asked Mrs. Ford.--\\n\"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard\\'s. Only my pattern gown is\\nat Hartfield.  No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.\\nBut then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the\\npattern gown home any day.  But I shall want the ribbon directly--\\nso it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon.  You could\\nmake it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?\"\\n\\n\"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble\\nof two parcels.\"\\n\\n\"No more it is.\"\\n\\n\"No trouble in the world, ma\\'am,\" said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\\n\\n\"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.\\nThen, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard\\'s--\\nI do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well\\nhave it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.\\nWhat do you advise?\"\\n\\n\"That you do not give another half-second to the subject.\\nTo Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, that will be much best,\" said Harriet, quite satisfied,\\n\"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard\\'s.\"\\n\\nVoices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies:\\nMrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Woodhouse,\" said the latter, \"I am just run across to\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.\\nHow do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged\\nMrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\"\\n\\n\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"\\n\\n\"Very well, I am much obliged to you.  My mother is delightfully well;\\nand Jane caught no cold last night.  How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\\nto hear such a good account.  Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--\\nOh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will\\nallow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother\\nwill be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party,\\nshe cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,\\' said Mr. Frank Churchill,\\n`Miss Woodhouse\\'s opinion of the instrument will be worth having.\\'--\\nBut, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go\\nwith me.--`Oh,\\' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished\\nmy job;\\'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,\\nin the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my\\nmother\\'s spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.--\\nSo very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--\\ncould not put them on.  And, by the bye, every body ought to have\\ntwo pair of spectacles; they should indeed.  Jane said so.\\nI meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\\nthen another, there is no saying what, you know.  At one time Patty came\\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping.  Oh, said I,\\nPatty do not come with your bad news to me.  Here is the rivet\\nof your mistress\\'s spectacles out.  Then the baked apples came home,\\nMrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and\\nobliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people\\nsay that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,\\nbut we have never known any thing but the greatest attention\\nfrom them.  And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,\\nfor what is our consumption of bread, you know?  Only three of us.--\\nbesides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such\\na shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.\\nI dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one\\nthing and then I say another, and it passes off.  But about the\\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes\\nso well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\\nfor I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry;\\nI happened to meet him in the street.  Not that I had any doubt before--\\nI have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.\\nI believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the\\nfruit thoroughly wholesome.  We have apple-dumplings, however,\\nvery often.  Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,\\nMrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will\\noblige us.\"\\n\\nEmma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they\\ndid at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss\\nBates than,\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?  I beg your pardon.  I did not see\\nyou before.  I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons\\nfrom town.  Jane came back delighted yesterday.  Thank ye,\\nthe gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;\\nbut Jane is taking them in.\"\\n\\n\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were\\nall in the street.\\n\\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\\n\\n\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my\\nmother\\'s spectacles.  So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!\\n`Oh!\\' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job\\nof this kind excessively.\\'--Which you know shewed him to be so\\nvery. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him\\nbefore and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any\\nthing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly.\\nHe seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!\\' said he,\\n`I can fasten the rivet.  I like a job of that sort excessively.\\'\\nI never shall forget his manner.  And when I brought out the baked\\napples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\\nobliging as to take some, `Oh!\\' said he directly, `there is nothing\\nin the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\\nhome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.\\'  That, you know, was so\\nvery. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.\\nIndeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them\\nfull justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,\\nand Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--\\nbut Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.  The apples\\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;\\nall from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley\\'s most liberal supply.\\nHe sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such\\na keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there\\nis two of them.  My mother says the orchard was always famous\\nin her younger days.  But I was really quite shocked the other day--\\nfor Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples,\\nand we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,\\nand he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.\\n`I am sure you must be,\\' said he, `and I will send you\\nanother supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.\\nWilliam Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.\\nI will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.\\'\\nSo I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could\\nnot absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half\\na dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could\\nnot at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he\\nhad been already; and Jane said the same.  And when he was gone,\\nshe almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled,\\nfor we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed\\nthat I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had\\nmade him believe we had a great many left.  Oh, said I, my dear,\\nI did say as much as I could.  However, the very same evening\\nWilliam Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same\\nsort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,\\nand went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,\\nas you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!\\nI am always glad to see him.  But, however, I found afterwards\\nfrom Patty, that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort\\nhis master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not\\none left to bake or boil.  William did not seem to mind it himself,\\nhe was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,\\nyou know, thinks more of his master\\'s profit than any thing;\\nbut Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being\\nall sent away.  She could not bear that her master should not be\\nable to have another apple-tart this spring.  He told Patty this,\\nbut bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us\\nabout it, for Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as\\nso many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.\\nAnd so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!\\nI would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for\\nthe world!  He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from\\nJane\\'s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was\\naware.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\\n\\n\"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.\\nPray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--\\nrather darker and narrower than one could wish.  Miss Smith,\\npray take care.  Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you\\nhit your foot.  Miss Smith, the step at the turning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,\\nwas tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table\\nnear her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\\n\\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\\nhappy countenance on seeing Emma again.\\n\\n\"This is a pleasure,\" said he, in rather a low voice, \"coming at\\nleast ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.  You find me\\ntrying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" said Mrs. Weston, \"have not you finished it yet? you would\\nnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\"\\n\\n\"I have not been working uninterruptedly,\" he replied, \"I have been\\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.\\nYou see we have been wedging one leg with paper.  This was very kind\\nof you to be persuaded to come.  I was almost afraid you would be\\nhurrying home.\"\\n\\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying\\nto make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was\\nquite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.  That she was not\\nimmediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;\\nshe had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it\\nwithout emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;\\nand Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,\\nand could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\\n\\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,\\nthe powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.\\nMrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;\\nEmma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every\\nproper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the\\nhighest promise.\\n\\n\"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\" said Frank Churchill,\\nwith a smile at Emma, \"the person has not chosen ill.  I heard a good\\ndeal of Colonel Campbell\\'s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the\\nupper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\\nparticularly prize.  I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave\\nhis friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.\\nDo not you think so?\"\\n\\nJane did not look round.  She was not obliged to hear.  Mrs. Weston\\nhad been speaking to her at the same moment.\\n\\n\"It is not fair,\" said Emma, in a whisper; \"mine was a random guess.\\nDo not distress her.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\\ndoubt and very little mercy.  Soon afterwards he began again,\\n\\n\"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure\\non this occasion, Miss Fairfax.  I dare say they often think of you,\\nand wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument\\'s\\ncoming to hand.  Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business\\nto be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be\\nthe consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may\\nhave sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time,\\nto depend upon contingencies and conveniences?\"\\n\\nHe paused.  She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\\n\\n\"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\" said she, in a voice\\nof forced calmness, \"I can imagine nothing with any confidence.\\nIt must be all conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes\\none conjectures wrong.  I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall\\nmake this rivet quite firm.  What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhen hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen,\\nI suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get\\nhold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.\\nThere, it is done.  I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)\\nof restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.\"\\n\\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape\\na little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged\\nMiss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\\n\\n\"If you are very kind,\" said he, \"it will be one of the waltzes\\nwe danced last night;--let me live them over again.  You did not\\nenjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.  I believe\\nyou were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--\\nall the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour.\"\\n\\nShe played.\\n\\n\"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy!--\\nIf I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\\nsomething else.  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\\nand turning to Emma, said,\\n\\n\"Here is something quite new to me.  Do you know it?--Cramer.--\\nAnd here are a new set of Irish melodies.  That, from such a quarter,\\none might expect.  This was all sent with the instrument.  Very thoughtful\\nof Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have\\nno music here.  I honour that part of the attention particularly;\\nit shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.  Nothing hastily\\ndone; nothing incomplete.  True affection only could have prompted it.\"\\n\\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught\\nthe remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush\\nof consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,\\nshe had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction\\nwith respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax\\nwas apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.\\n\\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--\\nEmma took the opportunity of whispering,\\n\\n\"You speak too plain.  She must understand you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope she does.  I would have her understand me.  I am not\\nin the least ashamed of my meaning.\"\\n\\n\"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up\\nthe idea.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me.\\nI have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.  Leave shame to her.\\nIf she does wrong, she ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"She is not entirely without it, I think.\"\\n\\n\"I do not see much sign of it.  She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_\\nat this moment--_his_ favourite.\"\\n\\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window,\\ndescried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible,\\njust to thank him.  I will not open the window here; it would give\\nyou all cold; but I can go into my mother\\'s room you know.  I dare\\nsay he will come in when he knows who is here.  Quite delightful\\nto have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!\"\\n\\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening\\nthe casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley\\'s attention,\\nand every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard\\nby the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.\\n\\n\"How d\\' ye do?--how d\\'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.  So obliged\\nto you for the carriage last night.  We were just in time;\\nmy mother just ready for us.  Pray come in; do come in.  You will\\nfind some friends here.\"\\n\\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard\\nin his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\\n\\n\"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,\\nbut particularly your niece.  How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she\\ncaught no cold last night.  How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss\\nFairfax is.\"\\n\\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he\\nwould hear her in any thing else.  The listeners were amused;\\nand Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.  But Emma\\nstill shook her head in steady scepticism.\\n\\n\"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\"\\nresumed Miss Bates.\\n\\nHe cut her short with,\\n\\n\"I am going to Kingston.  Can I do any thing for you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day\\nshe wanted something from Kingston.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Cole has servants to send.  Can I do any thing for _you_?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you.  But do come in.  Who do you think is here?--\\nMiss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the\\nnew pianoforte.  Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, in a deliberating manner, \"for five minutes, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\\nso many friends!\"\\n\\n\"No, not now, I thank you.  I could not stay two minutes.\\nI must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do come in.  They will be so very happy to see you.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; your room is full enough.  I will call another day,\\nand hear the pianoforte.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh!  Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party\\nlast night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--\\nWas not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill;\\nI never saw any thing equal to it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose\\nMiss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing\\nthat passes.  And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss\\nFairfax should not be mentioned too.  I think Miss Fairfax dances\\nvery well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player,\\nwithout exception, in England.  Now, if your friends have any gratitude,\\nthey will say something pretty loud about you and me in return;\\nbut I cannot stay to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--\\nso shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter now?\"\\n\\n\"To think of your sending us all your store apples.  You said you had\\na great many, and now you have not one left.  We really are so shocked!\\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry.  William Larkins mentioned it here.\\nYou should not have done it, indeed you should not.  Ah! he is off.\\nHe never can bear to be thanked.  But I thought he would have staid now,\\nand it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,\\n(returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed.\\nMr. Knightley cannot stop.  He is going to Kingston.  He asked me\\nif he could do any thing. . . .\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Jane, \"we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door\\nwas open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.\\nYou must have heard every thing to be sure.  `Can I do any thing\\nfor you at Kingston?\\' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come--so very\\nobliging of you.\"\\n\\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already\\nlasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was\\nperceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking\\nleave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young\\nladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely.  Instances have\\nbeen known of young people passing many, many months successively,\\nwithout being at any ball of any description, and no material injury\\naccrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--\\nwhen the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly,\\nfelt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\\n\\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\\npeople in schemes on the subject.  Frank\\'s was the first idea;\\nand his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best\\njudge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation\\nand appearance.  But still she had inclination enough for shewing\\npeople again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\\nWoodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare\\nherself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,\\nwithout any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first\\nin pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made\\nto hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour,\\nin the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could\\nsay of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.\\n\\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole\\'s\\nshould be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\\nand the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.\\nMr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,\\nand Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they\\ncould wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed,\\nof reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the\\nindispensable division of space to every couple.\\n\\n\"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two\\nMiss Coxes five,\" had been repeated many times over.  \"And there\\nwill be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself,\\nbesides Mr. Knightley.  Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.\\nYou and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\\nCoxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.\"\\n\\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\\n\\n\"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\\nthere will.\"\\n\\nOn another,\\n\\n\"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth\\nwhile to stand up.  Five couple are nothing, when one thinks\\nseriously about it.  It will not do to _invite_ five couple.\\nIt can be allowable only as the thought of the moment.\"\\n\\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother\\'s,\\nand must be invited with the rest.  Somebody else believed\\n_Mrs_. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had\\nbeen asked.  A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last,\\nMr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included,\\nand another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out,\\nit became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten,\\nand a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they\\ncould be disposed of.\\n\\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.\\n\"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\"\\nIt seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that\\nmany of them wanted a better.  Emma said it would be awkward;\\nMrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse\\nopposed it earnestly, on the score of health.  It made him so\\nvery unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.\\n\\n\"Oh! no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence.\\nI could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.  She would\\ncatch a dreadful cold.  So would poor little Harriet.\\nSo you would all.  Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up;\\ndo not let them talk of such a wild thing.  Pray do not let them\\ntalk of it.  That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.\\nDo not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.\\nHe has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping\\nthem open very inconsiderately.  He does not think of the draught.\\nI do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite\\nthe thing!\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.  She knew the importance\\nof it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.  Every door\\nwas now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme\\nof dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;\\nand with such good-will on Frank Churchill\\'s part, that the space\\nwhich a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient\\nfor five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough\\nfor ten.\\n\\n\"We were too magnificent,\" said he.  \"We allowed unnecessary room.\\nTen couple may stand here very well.\"\\n\\nEmma demurred.  \"It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could\\nbe worse than dancing without space to turn in?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" he gravely replied; \"it was very bad.\"  But still he\\nwent on measuring, and still he ended with,\\n\\n\"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said she, \"you are quite unreasonable.  It would be dreadful\\nto be standing so close!  Nothing can be farther from pleasure\\nthan to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\"\\n\\n\"There is no denying it,\" he replied.  \"I agree with you exactly.\\nA crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\\npictures in a few words.  Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,\\nhaving proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.\\nIt would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do\\nnot know that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand\\nhere very well.\"\\n\\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure\\nof dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave\\nthe rest.  Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been\\nworth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value\\nof his preference, and the character of his temper; but for\\nall the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance\\nof the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the\\nterrors of my father\\'s little rooms.  I bring a new proposal\\non the subject:--a thought of my father\\'s, which waits only your\\napprobation to be acted upon.  May I hope for the honour of your\\nhand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,\\nto be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?\"\\n\\n\"The Crown!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\\nBetter accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\\nwelcome than at Randalls.  It is his own idea.  Mrs. Weston sees\\nno objection to it, provided you are satisfied.  This is what we\\nall feel.  Oh! you were perfectly right!  Ten couple, in either of\\nthe Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt\\nhow right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing\\n_any_ _thing_ to like to yield.  Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--\\nI hope you consent?\"\\n\\n\"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston do not.  I think it admirable; and, as far as I can\\nanswer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement\\nthat could be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\"\\n\\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations\\nwere necessary to make it acceptable.\\n\\n\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--\\nmuch worse than the other.  A room at an inn was always damp\\nand dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.\\nIf they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.  He had never\\nbeen in the room at the Crown in his life--did not know the people\\nwho kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan.  They would catch\\nworse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"I was going to observe, sir,\" said Frank Churchill,\\n\"that one of the great recommendations of this change would\\nbe the very little danger of any body\\'s catching cold--\\nso much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!  Mr. Perry\\nmight have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \"you are very much\\nmistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.\\nMr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.  But I\\ndo not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you\\nthan your father\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.  We shall have\\nno occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening;\\nand it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold\\nair upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\"\\n\\n\"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think\\nof opening the windows at Randalls.  Nobody could be so imprudent!\\nI never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open windows!--I am sure,\\nneither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)\\nwould suffer it.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind\\na window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.\\nI have often known it done myself.\"\\n\\n\"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!  I never could have supposed it.\\nBut I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.\\nHowever, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come\\nto talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal\\nof consideration.  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.\\nIf Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,\\nwe may talk it over, and see what can be done.\"\\n\\n\"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Emma, \"there will be plenty of time for talking\\nevery thing over.  There is no hurry at all.  If it can be contrived\\nto be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.\\nThey will be so near their own stable.\"\\n\\n\"So they will, my dear.  That is a great thing.  Not that James\\never complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.\\nIf I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is\\nMrs. Stokes to be trusted?  I doubt it.  I do not know her,\\neven by sight.\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will\\nbe under Mrs. Weston\\'s care.  Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct\\nthe whole.\"\\n\\n\"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,\\nwho is carefulness itself.  Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said,\\nso many years ago, when I had the measles?  `If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes\\nto wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.\\'  How often\\nhave I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, very true.  Mr. Perry did say so.  I shall never forget it.\\nPoor little Emma!  You were very bad with the measles; that is,\\nyou would have been very bad, but for Perry\\'s great attention.\\nHe came four times a day for a week.  He said, from the first,\\nit was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles\\nare a dreadful complaint.  I hope whenever poor Isabella\\'s little ones\\nhave the measles, she will send for Perry.\"\\n\\n\"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\"\\nsaid Frank Churchill, \"examining the capabilities of the house.\\nI left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,\\nand hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice\\non the spot.  I was desired to say so from both.  It would be the\\ngreatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.\\nThey can do nothing satisfactorily without you.\"\\n\\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young\\npeople set off together without delay for the Crown.  There were\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation,\\nvery busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some\\nlittle distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.\\n\\n\"Emma,\" said she, \"this paper is worse than I expected.\\nLook! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot\\nis more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband.  \"What does\\nall that signify?  You will see nothing of it by candlelight.\\nIt will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.  We never see any\\nthing of it on our club-nights.\"\\n\\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \"Men never\\nknow when things are dirty or not;\" and the gentlemen perhaps\\nthought each to himself, \"Women will have their little nonsenses\\nand needless cares.\"\\n\\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\\nIt regarded a supper-room.  At the time of the ballroom\\'s being built,\\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining,\\nwas the only addition.  What was to be done?  This card-room would\\nbe wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted\\nunnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for\\nany comfortable supper?  Another room of much better size might be\\nsecured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,\\nand a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.\\nThis made a difficulty.  Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts\\nfor the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the\\ngentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded\\nat supper.\\n\\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\\n&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a\\nwretched suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper,\\nwas pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;\\nand Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.  She then took another\\nline of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\\n\\n\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.  We shall not be many,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\\nthrough the passage, was calling out,\\n\\n\"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.\\nIt is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from\\nthe stairs.\"\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"one could know which arrangement our\\nguests in general would like best.  To do what would be most generally\\npleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very true,\" cried Frank, \"very true.  You want your neighbours\\'\\nopinions.  I do not wonder at you.  If one could ascertain what the\\nchief of them--the Coles, for instance.  They are not far off.\\nShall I call upon them?  Or Miss Bates?  She is still nearer.--\\nAnd I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand\\nthe inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.  I think\\nwe do want a larger council.  Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates\\nto join us?\"\\n\\n\"Well--if you please,\" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \"if you\\nthink she will be of any use.\"\\n\\n\"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\" said Emma.\\n\"She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.\\nShe will not even listen to your questions.  I see no advantage in\\nconsulting Miss Bates.\"\\n\\n\"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!  I am very fond\\nof hearing Miss Bates talk.  And I need not bring the whole family,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,\\ngave it his decided approbation.\\n\\n\"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter\\nat once.  She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know\\na properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.\\nFetch Miss Bates.  We are growing a little too nice.  She is\\na standing lesson of how to be happy.  But fetch them both.\\nInvite them both.\"\\n\\n\"Both sir!  Can the old lady?\" . . .\\n\\n\"The old lady!  No, the young lady, to be sure.  I shall think you\\na great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  I beg your pardon, sir.  I did not immediately recollect.\\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\"\\nAnd away he ran.\\n\\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\\nand her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered\\nwoman and a good wife, had examined the passage again,\\nand found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--\\nindeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.\\nAll the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.\\nAll the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music,\\ntea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles\\nto be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--\\nEvery body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written\\nto Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\\nwhich could not possibly be refused.  And a delightful dance it was\\nto be.\\n\\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\\nAs a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much\\nsafer character,) she was truly welcome.  Her approbation, at once\\ngeneral and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;\\nand for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro,\\nbetween the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending,\\nand all in happy enjoyment of the future.  The party did not break\\nup without Emma\\'s being positively secured for the two first dances\\nby the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston\\nwhisper to his wife, \"He has asked her, my dear.  That\\'s right.\\nI knew he would!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball\\ncompletely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within\\nthe granted term of Frank Churchill\\'s stay in Surry; for, in spite\\nof Mr. Weston\\'s confidence, she could not think it so very impossible\\nthat the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain\\na day beyond his fortnight.  But this was not judged feasible.\\nThe preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly\\nready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they\\nmust be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--\\nin her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.\\n\\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.\\nHis wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was\\nnot opposed.  All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\\nsolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain\\nof her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley\\'s\\nprovoking indifference about it.  Either because he did not\\ndance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his\\nbeing consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,\\ndetermined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording\\nhim any future amusement.  To her voluntary communications Emma\\ncould get no more approving reply, than,\\n\\n\"Very well.  If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing\\nto say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--\\nOh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep\\nas much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over\\nWilliam Larkins\\'s week\\'s account; much rather, I confess.--\\nPleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--\\nI do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,\\nmust be its own reward.  Those who are standing by are usually\\nthinking of something very different.\"\\n\\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.\\nIt was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was\\nso indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings\\nin reprobating the ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it\\nto an extraordinary degree.  It made her animated--open hearted--\\nshe voluntarily said;--\\n\\n\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\\nWhat a disappointment it would be!  I do look forward to it, I own,\\nwith _very_ great pleasure.\"\\n\\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\\npreferred the society of William Larkins.  No!--she was more and more\\nconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.\\nThere was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment\\non his side--but no love.\\n\\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.\\nTwo days of joyful security were immediately followed by the\\nover-throw of every thing.  A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill\\nto urge his nephew\\'s instant return.  Mrs. Churchill was unwell--\\nfar too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering\\nstate (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,\\nthough from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant\\nhabit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;\\nbut now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off\\nfor Enscombe without delay.\\n\\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note\\nfrom Mrs. Weston, instantly.  As to his going, it was inevitable.\\nHe must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real\\nalarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance.  He knew her illnesses;\\nthey never occurred but for her own convenience.\\n\\nMrs. Weston added, \"that he could only allow himself time to\\nhurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few\\nfriends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;\\nand that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon.\"\\n\\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma\\'s breakfast.  When once\\nit had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament\\nand exclaim.  The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--\\nand all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--\\nSuch a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!\\nand she and her partner the happiest!--\"I said it would be so,\"\\nwas the only consolation.\\n\\nHer father\\'s feelings were quite distinct.  He thought principally\\nof Mrs. Churchill\\'s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated;\\nand as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;\\nbut they would all be safer at home.\\n\\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared;\\nbut if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful\\nlook and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.\\nHe felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.  His dejection\\nwas most evident.  He sat really lost in thought for the first\\nfew minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,\\n\\n\"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.\"\\n\\n\"But you will come again,\" said Emma.  \"This will not be your only\\nvisit to Randalls.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able\\nto return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object\\nof all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town\\nthis spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--\\nI am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Our poor ball must be quite given up.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the\\npleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\\nfoolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhy are you always so right?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.  I would\\nmuch rather have been merry than wise.\"\\n\\n\"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball.  My father\\ndepends on it.  Do not forget your engagement.\"\\n\\nEmma looked graciously.\\n\\n\"Such a fortnight as it has been!\" he continued; \"every day more\\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\\nme less fit to bear any other place.  Happy those, who can remain\\nat Highbury!\"\\n\\n\"As you do us such ample justice now,\" said Emma, laughing, \"I will\\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations?  I am sure we do.\\nI am sure you did not much expect to like us.  You would not have been\\nso long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\"\\n\\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,\\nEmma was convinced that it had been so.\\n\\n\"And you must be off this very morning?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; my father is to join me here:  we shall walk back together,\\nand I must be off immediately.  I am almost afraid that every moment\\nwill bring him.\"\\n\\n\"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and\\nMiss Bates?  How unlucky!  Miss Bates\\'s powerful, argumentative mind\\nmight have strengthened yours.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better.\\nIt was a right thing to do.  I went in for three minutes, and was\\ndetained by Miss Bates\\'s being absent.  She was out; and I felt it\\nimpossible not to wait till she came in.  She is a woman that one may,\\nthat one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.\\nIt was better to pay my visit, then\"--\\n\\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\\n\\n\"In short,\" said he, \"perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can\\nhardly be quite without suspicion\"--\\n\\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.  She hardly\\nknew what to say.  It seemed like the forerunner of something\\nabsolutely serious, which she did not wish.  Forcing herself\\nto speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\\n\\n\"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then\"--\\n\\nHe was silent.  She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.\\nShe heard him sigh.  It was natural for him to feel that he had\\n_cause_ to sigh.  He could not believe her to be encouraging him.\\nA few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more\\ndetermined manner said,\\n\\n\"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be\\ngiven to Hartfield.  My regard for Hartfield is most warm\"--\\n\\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--\\nHe was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say\\nhow it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?\\nMr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made\\nhim composed.\\n\\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.\\nMr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as\\nincapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable,\\nas of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, \"It was time to go;\"\\nand the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree,\\nto take leave.\\n\\n\"I shall hear about you all,\" said he; \"that is my chief consolation.\\nI shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.  I have\\nengaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me.  She has been so kind as\\nto promise it.  Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one\\nis really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing.\\nIn her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.\"\\n\\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest \"Good-bye,\"\\nclosed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.\\nShort had been the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma\\nfelt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little\\nsociety from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry,\\nand feeling it too much.\\n\\nIt was a sad change.  They had been meeting almost every day\\nsince his arrival.  Certainly his being at Randalls had given\\ngreat spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea,\\nthe expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,\\nthe assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!\\nIt had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking\\nfrom it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every\\nother recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her.\\nWhat strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,\\nwas another point; but at present she could not doubt his having\\na decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;\\nand this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that\\nshe _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous\\ndetermination against it.\\n\\n\"I certainly must,\" said she.  \"This sensation of listlessness,\\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\\nthis feeling of every thing\\'s being dull and insipid about the house!--\\nI must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\\nwere not--for a few weeks at least.  Well! evil to some is always\\ngood to others.  I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,\\nif not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.\\nHe may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.  He could\\nnot say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look\\nwould have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily,\\nthat he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with\\nconsiderable kindness added,\\n\\n\"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really\\nout of luck; you are very much out of luck!\"\\n\\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her\\nhonest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,\\nher composure was odious.  She had been particularly unwell, however,\\nsuffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,\\nthat had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have\\nattended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming\\nindifference to the languor of ill-health.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.  Her ideas\\nonly varied as to the how much.  At first, she thought it was a good deal;\\nand afterwards, but little.  She had great pleasure in hearing Frank\\nChurchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\\nin seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,\\nand quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was,\\nhow were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance\\nof his coming to Randalls again this spring.  But, on the other hand,\\nshe could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the\\nfirst morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;\\nshe was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could\\nyet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him\\nso much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand\\namusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,\\nfancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;\\nthe conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she\\n_refused_ _him_.  Their affection was always to subside into friendship.\\nEvery thing tender and charming was to mark their parting;\\nbut still they were to part.  When she became sensible of this,\\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite\\nof her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father,\\nnever to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more\\nof a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.\\n\\n\"I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\" said she.--\\n\"In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives,\\nis there any allusion to making a sacrifice.  I do suspect that he\\nis not really necessary to my happiness.  So much the better.\\nI certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.  I am\\nquite enough in love.  I should be sorry to be more.\"\\n\\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.\\n\\n\"_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much\\nin love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue,\\nI must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\\ninexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.\\nNot that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto.\\nNo, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would\\nnot have been so wretched.  Could he have thought himself encouraged,\\nhis looks and language at parting would have been different.--\\nStill, however, I must be on my guard.  This is in the supposition\\nof his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I\\nexpect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man--\\nI do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--\\nHis feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--\\nEvery consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful\\nthat my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well\\nagain after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;\\nfor they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall\\nhave been let off easily.\"\\n\\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;\\nand she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made\\nher at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she\\nhad undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter,\\ngiving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,\\nexpressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was\\nnatural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local\\nthat could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.\\nNo suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the\\nlanguage of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition\\nfrom Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some\\nof the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on\\nto shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been\\nsaid but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own\\nname was not wanting.  _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once,\\nand never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\\ncompliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;\\nand in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it\\nwas by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern\\nthe effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment\\nperhaps of all conveyed.  Compressed into the very lowest vacant\\ncorner were these words--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,\\nas you know, for Miss Woodhouse\\'s beautiful little friend.  Pray make\\nmy excuses and adieus to her.\"  This, Emma could not doubt, was all\\nfor herself.  Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend.\\nHis information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor\\nbetter than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,\\nand he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for\\ncoming to Randalls again.\\n\\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the\\nmaterial part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up\\nand returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,\\nthat she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn\\nto do without her.  Her intentions were unchanged.  Her resolution\\nof refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for\\nhis subsequent consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet,\\nand the words which clothed it, the \"beautiful little friend,\"\\nsuggested to her the idea of Harriet\\'s succeeding her in his affections.\\nWas it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his\\ninferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with\\nthe loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;\\nand all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in\\nher favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\\n\\n\"I must not dwell upon it,\" said she.--\"I must not think of it.\\nI know the danger of indulging such speculations.  But stranger\\nthings have happened; and when we cease to care for each other\\nas we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort\\nof true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward\\nto with pleasure.\"\\n\\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet\\'s behalf,\\nthough it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil\\nin that quarter was at hand.  As Frank Churchill\\'s arrival had\\nsucceeded Mr. Elton\\'s engagement in the conversation of Highbury,\\nas the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now\\nupon Frank Churchill\\'s disappearance, Mr. Elton\\'s concerns were\\nassuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.\\nHe would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.\\nThere was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe\\nbefore \"Mr. Elton and his bride\" was in every body\\'s mouth,\\nand Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma grew sick at the sound.\\nShe had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;\\nand Harriet\\'s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately\\ngaining strength.  With Mr. Weston\\'s ball in view at least,\\nthere had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;\\nbut it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state\\nof composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,\\nbell-ringing, and all.\\n\\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma\\ncould give.  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,\\nthat Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;\\nbut it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing\\nany effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions\\nthe same.  Harriet listened submissively, and said \"it was very true--\\nit was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to\\nthink about them--and she would not think about them any longer\"\\nbut no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour\\nsaw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.\\nAt last Emma attacked her on another ground.\\n\\n\"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about\\nMr. Elton\\'s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can\\nmake _me_.  You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I\\nfell into.  It was all my doing, I know.  I have not forgotten it,\\nI assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--\\nand it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.  Do not imagine\\nme in danger of forgetting it.\"\\n\\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words\\nof eager exclamation.  Emma continued,\\n\\n\"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,\\ntalk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,\\nI would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important\\nthan my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration\\nof what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour\\nto avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,\\nand restore your tranquillity.  These are the motives which I\\nhave been pressing on you.  They are very important--and sorry\\nI am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.\\nMy being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.  I want\\nyou to save yourself from greater pain.  Perhaps I may sometimes\\nhave felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather\\nwhat would be kind by me.\"\\n\\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.\\nThe idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,\\nand when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained\\npowerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it\\nvery tolerably.\\n\\n\"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--\\nWant gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody\\nas I do for you!--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\"\\n\\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look\\nand manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet\\nso well, nor valued her affection so highly before.\\n\\n\"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\" said she\\nafterwards to herself.  \"There is nothing to be compared to it.\\nWarmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,\\nwill beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,\\nI am sure it will.  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear\\nfather so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--\\nI have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is\\nmy superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.\\nDear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,\\nlongest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.  Oh! the coldness\\nof a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--\\na sensible man\\'s wife--it is invaluable.  I mention no names;\\nbut happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might\\nbe interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,\\nand it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,\\nto settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,\\nor not pretty at all.\\n\\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,\\nto make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;\\nand she made a point of Harriet\\'s going with her, that the worst of\\nthe business might be gone through as soon as possible.\\n\\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room\\nto which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,\\nto lace up her boot, without _recollecting_.  A thousand vexatious\\nthoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;\\nand it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be\\nrecollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather\\npale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so\\nmuch embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma\\nwould not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,\\nand on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms\\nof being \"elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\"\\n\\nShe did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,\\nthere was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face\\nnot unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,\\nwere elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.\\n\\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would\\nnot permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.\\nIt was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,\\nand a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.\\nThe woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,\\nand the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own\\ngood sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly\\nunlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with\\nthe woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,\\nand the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him\\nto have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,\\nand as little really easy as could be.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted\\nthe house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--\\nIs not she very charming?\"\\n\\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma\\'s answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\"\\n\\n\"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\"\\n\\n\"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;\\nand she came in his way.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" returned Harriet, sighing again, \"I dare say she\\nwas very much attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man\\'s fate to marry the\\nwoman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,\\nand thought this the best offer she was likely to have.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harriet earnestly, \"and well she might, nobody could ever\\nhave a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,\\nMiss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.\\nHe is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,\\nit is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need\\nnot be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.\\nTo know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--\\nShe does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.\\nHappy creature!  He called her `Augusta.\\'  How delightful!\"\\n\\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then\\nsee more and judge better.  From Harriet\\'s happening not to be\\nat Hartfield, and her father\\'s being present to engage Mr. Elton,\\nshe had a quarter of an hour of the lady\\'s conversation to herself,\\nand could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite\\nconvinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well\\nsatisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;\\nthat she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which\\nhad been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her\\nnotions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;\\nthat if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would\\ncertainly do Mr. Elton no good.\\n\\nHarriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined herself,\\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,\\nit might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best\\nof her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride\\nof the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride\\nof him.\\n\\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \"My brother\\nMr. Suckling\\'s seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.\\nThe grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the\\nhouse was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably\\nimpressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she\\ncould see or imagine.  \"Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite\\nstruck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size\\nof the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister\\'s favourite room.\"--\\nMr. Elton was appealed to.--\"Was not it astonishingly like?--\\nShe could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like\\nthe staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.\\nI really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nit is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so\\nextremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy\\nmonths there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,\\nundoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;\\nbut to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,\\nlike me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it\\nis to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.\\nI always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.\"\\n\\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\\n\\n\"So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--\\nthe grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly\\nlike.  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here,\\nand stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;\\nand I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,\\nwhich put me so exactly in mind!  My brother and sister will be\\nenchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds\\nthemselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.\"\\n\\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea\\nthat people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little\\nfor the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth\\nwhile to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said\\nin reply,\\n\\n\"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\\nyou have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,\\nyou know.  Surry is the garden of England.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.\\nMany counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,\\nas well as Surry.\"\\n\\n\"No, I fancy not,\" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\"\\nI never heard any county but Surry called so.\"\\n\\nEmma was silenced.\\n\\n\"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,\\nor summer at farthest,\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"and that will be\\nour time for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore\\na great deal, I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau,\\nof course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying\\nany thing of _our_ carriage, we should be able to explore the different\\nbeauties extremely well.  They would hardly come in their chaise,\\nI think, at that season of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on,\\nI shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;\\nit will be so very much preferable.  When people come into a beautiful\\ncountry of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes\\nthem to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond\\nof exploring.  We explored to King\\'s-Weston twice last summer,\\nin that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the\\nbarouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,\\nMiss Woodhouse, every summer?\"\\n\\n\"No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;\\nand we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed\\nto stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.\\nNobody can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite\\na proverb for it at Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said,\\nwhen she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl\\nto move from the house.  I absolutely must go in by myself, though I\\nhate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;\\nbut Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir\\nbeyond the park paling.\\'  Many a time has she said so; and yet I\\nam no advocate for entire seclusion.  I think, on the contrary,\\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\\nbad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\\na proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.\\nI perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--\\n(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father\\'s state of health must\\nbe a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should.\\nLet me recommend Bath to you.  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing\\nMr. Woodhouse good.\"\\n\\n\"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving\\nany benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown\\nto you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be\\nuseful now.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that\\'s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhere the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief\\nthey give.  In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!\\nAnd it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of\\nuse to Mr. Woodhouse\\'s spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes\\nmuch depressed.  And as to its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I\\nneed not take much pains to dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath\\nto the young are pretty generally understood.  It would be a charming\\nintroduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could\\nimmediately secure you some of the best society in the place.\\nA line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my\\nparticular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided\\nwith when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,\\nand would be the very person for you to go into public with.\"\\n\\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.\\nThe idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called\\nan _introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices\\nof a friend of Mrs. Elton\\'s--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,\\nwho, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--\\nThe dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\\n\\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\\nhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going\\nto Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly\\nconvinced that the place might suit her better than her father.\"\\nAnd then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the\\nsubject directly.\\n\\n\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these occasions,\\na lady\\'s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long\\nknown that you are a superior performer.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.\\nA superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.\\nConsider from how partial a quarter your information came.\\nI am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends\\nsay I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,\\nupon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree.\\nYou, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you\\nit has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,\\nto hear what a musical society I am got into.  I absolutely cannot\\ndo without music.  It is a necessary of life to me; and having always\\nbeen used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,\\nit would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much\\nto Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing\\nhis fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;\\nand the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been\\naccustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\\n_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear\\nof retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,\\nthe world was not necessary to _me_.  I could do very well without it.\\nTo those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my\\nresources made me quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms\\nthan I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought.\\nI hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.\\nCertainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I\\ndid assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,\\nnor were spacious apartments.  `But,\\' said I, `to be quite honest,\\nI do not think I can live without something of a musical society.\\nI condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank\\nto me.\\'\"\\n\\n\"We cannot suppose,\" said Emma, smiling, \"that Mr. Elton would hesitate\\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury;\\nand I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than\\nmay be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted\\nto find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet\\nlittle concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I\\nmust establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings\\nat your house, or ours.  Will not it be a good plan?  If _we_\\nexert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.\\nSomething of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_,\\nas an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--\\nthere is a sad story against them, in general.  They are but too apt\\nto give up music.\"\\n\\n\"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can\\nbe no danger, surely?\"\\n\\n\"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\\nI tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music--never touches\\nthe instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said\\nof Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,\\nnow Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.\\nUpon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used to be\\nquite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend\\nthat a married woman has many things to call her attention.\\nI believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.\"\\n\\n\"But every thing of that kind,\" said Emma, \"will soon\\nbe in so regular a train--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \"we shall see.\"\\n\\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,\\nhad nothing more to say; and, after a moment\\'s pause, Mrs. Elton\\nchose another subject.\\n\\n\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them\\nboth at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.\\nI like them extremely.  Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--\\nquite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.\\nAnd _she_ appears so truly good--there is something so motherly\\nand kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.\\nShe was your governess, I think?\"\\n\\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton\\nhardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.\\n\\n\"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her\\nso very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Weston\\'s manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good.\\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\\nmodel for any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"And who do you think came in while we were there?\"\\n\\nEmma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance--\\nand how could she possibly guess?\\n\\n\"Knightley!\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"Knightley himself!--Was not\\nit lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,\\nI had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a\\nfriend of Mr. E.\\'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley\\'\\nhad been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;\\nand I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not\\nbe ashamed of his friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman.\\nI like him very much.  Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.\"\\n\\nHappily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma\\ncould breathe.\\n\\n\"Insufferable woman!\" was her immediate exclamation.  \"Worse than I\\nhad supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not\\nhave believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,\\nand call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!\\nA little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_,\\nand her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and\\nunderbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is\\na gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,\\nand discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it!\\nAnd to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!\\nOne would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!--\\nAstonished that the person who had brought me up should be\\na gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal.\\nMuch beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.\\nOh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?\\nHow angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--\\nthinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of!\\nHow I catch myself out!  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into\\nmy mind!\"--\\n\\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time\\nher father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons\\'\\ndeparture, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable\\nof attending.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" he deliberately began, \"considering we never saw\\nher before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say\\nshe was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick.\\nA little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.\\nBut I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks\\nlike you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,\\npretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.\\nThough I think he had better not have married.  I made the best\\nexcuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton\\non this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course\\nof the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon\\na bride is very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!\\nBut I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects\\nto her if possible.  It was being very deficient.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore\\nwhy should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?\\nIt ought to be no recommendation to _you_.  It is encouraging people\\nto marry if you make so much of them.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would\\nalways wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,\\nespecially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to _her_.\\nA bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,\\nlet the others be who they may.\"\\n\\n\"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know\\nwhat is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your\\nsanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a\\nmatter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,\\nand has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.\"\\n\\nEmma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not\\nunderstand _her_.  Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton\\'s offences,\\nand long, very long, did they occupy her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\\nopinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct.\\nSuch as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,\\nsuch she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,\\nfamiliar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a\\nlittle accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself\\ncoming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve\\na country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held\\nsuch a place in society as Mrs. Elton\\'s consequence only could surpass.\\n\\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\\nfrom his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.\\nHe had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such\\na woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;\\nand the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,\\nor not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates\\'s\\ngood-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever\\nand as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;\\nso that Mrs. Elton\\'s praise passed from one mouth to another as it\\nought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her\\nfirst contribution and talked with a good grace of her being \"very\\npleasant and very elegantly dressed.\"\\n\\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared\\nat first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,\\nby the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,\\nshe drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold\\nand distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will\\nwhich produced it was necessarily increasing Emma\\'s dislike.\\nHer manners, too--and Mr. Elton\\'s, were unpleasant towards Harriet.\\nThey were sneering and negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work\\nHarriet\\'s cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour\\nsunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor\\nHarriet\\'s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,\\nand her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable\\nto her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been\\ngiven also.  She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--\\nWhen they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin\\nabusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew\\nin open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous\\ntreatment of Harriet.\\n\\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.\\nNot merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be\\nsupposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she\\nwas not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--\\nbut without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting\\nto assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,\\nand about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton\\'s\\nknight-errantry on the subject.--\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite\\nrave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.  So mild\\nand ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she\\nhas very extraordinary talents.  I do not scruple to say that she\\nplays extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly\\non that point.  Oh! she is absolutely charming!  You will laugh at\\nmy warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--\\nAnd her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,\\nwe must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.\\nWe must bring her forward.  Such talent as hers must not be suffered\\nto remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of\\nthe poet,\\n\\n        `Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\n          `And waste its fragrance on the desert air.\\'\\n\\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot think there is any danger of it,\" was Emma\\'s calm answer--\\n\"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax\\'s situation\\nand understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,\\nI have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,\\nsuch obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have\\nenjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!  And I think\\nshe feels it.  I am sure she does.  She is very timid and silent.\\nOne can see that she feels the want of encouragement.  I like her\\nthe better for it.  I must confess it is a recommendation to me.\\nI am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does\\nnot often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,\\nit is extremely prepossessing.  Oh!  I assure you, Jane Fairfax\\nis a very delightful character, and interests me more than I\\ncan express.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any\\nof Miss Fairfax\\'s acquaintance here, any of those who have known\\nher longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than\"--\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare\\nto act.  You and I need not be afraid.  If _we_ set the example,\\nmany will follow it as far as they can; though all have not\\nour situations.  _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home,\\nand _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of\\nJane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be\\nextremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,\\nas could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax\\nto partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of thing.  It is\\nnot likely that I _should_, considering what I have been used to.\\nMy greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.\\nMaple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--\\nfor we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,\\nin income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--\\nI shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce\\nher wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,\\nand shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.\\nMy acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt\\nof hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,\\nof course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come\\nto us.  I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets\\na little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,\\nfor there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is\\nhighly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they\\nare with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in\\nthe barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Jane Fairfax!\"--thought Emma.--\"You have not deserved this.\\nYou may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a\\npunishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection\\nof Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.\\'  Heavens!  Let me\\nnot suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--\\nBut upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness\\nof that woman\\'s tongue!\"\\n\\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\\naddressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a \"dear Miss\\nWoodhouse.\"  The change on Mrs. Elton\\'s side soon afterwards appeared,\\nand she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton\\'s guidance, the very\\nactive patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a\\ngeneral way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\\n\\nShe looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates\\'s gratitude for\\nMrs. Elton\\'s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\\nsimplicity and warmth.  She was quite one of her worthies--\\nthe most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished\\nand condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.\\nEmma\\'s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept\\nthose attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do.\\nShe heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,\\nspending a day with the Eltons!  This was astonishing!--She could not\\nhave believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax\\ncould endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\\n\\n\"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!\" said she.--\"To chuse to remain\\nhere month after month, under privations of every sort!  And now\\nto chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton\\'s notice and the penury\\nof her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions\\nwho have always loved her with such real, generous affection.\"\\n\\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells\\nhad promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,\\nand fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.\\nAccording to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had\\nwritten most pressingly.  Would Jane but go, means were to be found,\\nservants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed\\nto exist; but still she had declined it!\\n\\n\"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\\nthis invitation,\" was Emma\\'s conclusion.  \"She must be under some\\nsort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.\\nThere is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--\\nShe is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_.  The decree is issued by somebody.\\nBut why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a\\nseparate puzzle.\"\\n\\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,\\nbefore the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston\\nventured this apology for Jane.\\n\\n\"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\\nmy dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.\\nHer aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,\\nmust be very tiresome.  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,\\nbefore we condemn her taste for what she goes to.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have\\nchosen her.  But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives\\nattentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;\\nand she was herself struck by his warmth.  With a faint blush,\\nshe presently replied,\\n\\n\"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton\\'s, I should have imagined,\\nwould rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton\\'s\\ninvitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.\"\\n\\n\"I should not wonder,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if Miss Fairfax were to have\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt\\'s eagerness\\nin accepting Mrs. Elton\\'s civilities for her.  Poor Miss Bates may\\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,\\nin spite of the very natural wish of a little change.\"\\n\\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\\nminutes silence, he said,\\n\\n\"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton\\ndoes not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her.  We all know\\nthe difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest\\nspoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond\\ncommon civility in our personal intercourse with each other--\\na something more early implanted.  We cannot give any body the\\ndisagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.\\nWe feel things differently.  And besides the operation of this,\\nas a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes\\nMrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,\\nface to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she\\nhas a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell\\nin Mrs. Elton\\'s way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent\\nher acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not\\nin consciousness.\"\\n\\n\"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\" said Emma.\\nLittle Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy\\nmade her irresolute what else to say.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"any body may know how highly I think of her.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,\\nbut soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--\\nshe hurried on--\"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself\\nhow highly it is.  The extent of your admiration may take you by\\nsurprize some day or other.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,\\nor some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\\n\\n\"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.  Mr. Cole\\ngave me a hint of it six weeks ago.\"\\n\\nHe stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did\\nnot herself know what to think.  In a moment he went on--\\n\\n\"That will never be, however, I can assure you.  Miss Fairfax,\\nI dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very\\nsure I shall never ask her.\"\\n\\nEmma returned her friend\\'s pressure with interest; and was pleased\\nenough to exclaim,\\n\\n\"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.  I will say that for you.\"\\n\\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner\\nwhich shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you.  What I said\\njust now, meant nothing.  One says those sort of things, of course,\\nwithout any idea of a serious meaning.  Oh! no, upon my word I have not\\nthe smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.\\nYou would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,\\nif you were married.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,\\n\"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will\\never take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,\\nI assure you.\"  And soon afterwards, \"Jane Fairfax is a very charming\\nyoung woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.  She has a fault.\\nShe has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\"\\n\\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.\\n\"Well,\" said she, \"and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very soon.  He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more.  Cole does not want to be wiser\\nor wittier than his neighbours.\"\\n\\n\"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser\\nand wittier than all the world!  I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--\\nwhat she calls them!  How can she find any appellation for them,\\ndeep enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can\\nshe do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane\\nFairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.\\nMrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.  I can much more\\nreadily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,\\nthan I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax\\'s mind over\\nMrs. Elton.  I have no faith in Mrs. Elton\\'s acknowledging herself\\nthe inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any\\nrestraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot\\nimagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\"\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax has feeling,\" said Mr. Knightley--\"I do not\\naccuse her of want of feeling.  Her sensibilities, I suspect,\\nare strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,\\npatience, self-controul; but it wants openness.  She is reserved,\\nmore reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an\\nopen temper.  No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,\\nit had never entered my head.  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with\\nher, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mrs. Weston,\" said Emma triumphantly when he left them,\\n\"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley\\'s marrying Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied\\nby the idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder\\nif it were to end in his being so at last.  Do not beat me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,\\nwas disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.  Dinner-parties and\\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations\\nflowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending\\nthey were never to have a disengaged day.\\n\\n\"I see how it is,\" said she.  \"I see what a life I am to lead\\namong you.  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.\\nWe really seem quite the fashion.  If this is living in the country,\\nit is nothing very formidable.  From Monday next to Saturday,\\nI assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer\\nresources than I have, need not have been at a loss.\"\\n\\nNo invitation came amiss to her.  Her Bath habits made evening-parties\\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste\\nfor dinners.  She was a little shocked at the want of two\\ndrawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being\\nno ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,\\nMrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge\\nof the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought\\nto be arranged.  In the course of the spring she must return their\\ncivilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables\\nshould be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs\\nin the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening\\nthan their own establishment could furnish, to carry round\\nthe refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\\n\\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner\\nat Hartfield for the Eltons.  They must not do less than others,\\nor she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable\\nof pitiful resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had\\ntalked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,\\nand only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom\\nof the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding\\nwho should do it for him.\\n\\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the Eltons,\\nit must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--\\nand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\\nbe asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given\\nwith equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly\\npleased by Harriet\\'s begging to be allowed to decline it.\\n\"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.\\nShe was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\\nwife together, without feeling uncomfortable.  If Miss Woodhouse\\nwould not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.\"\\nIt was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it\\npossible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude\\nof her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give\\nup being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,\\nshe was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had\\noften been.--Mr. Knightley\\'s words dwelt with her.  He had said\\nthat Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody\\nelse paid her.\\n\\n\"This is very true,\" said she, \"at least as far as relates to me,\\nwhich was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--\\nand always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--\\nShe will never like me now.  I have neglected her too long.  But I\\nwill shew her greater attention than I have done.\"\\n\\nEvery invitation was successful.  They were all disengaged and all happy.--\\nThe preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.\\nA circumstance rather unlucky occurred.  The two eldest little\\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of\\nsome weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,\\nand staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be\\nthe very day of this party.--His professional engagements did\\nnot allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were\\ndisturbed by its happening so.  Mr. Woodhouse considered eight\\npersons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--\\nand here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would\\nbe a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even\\nto Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.\\n\\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,\\nby representing that though he certainly would make them nine,\\nyet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be\\nvery immaterial.  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself,\\nto have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed\\nto her instead of his brother.\\n\\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.\\nJohn Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town\\nand must be absent on the very day.  He might be able to join them\\nin the evening, but certainly not to dinner.  Mr. Woodhouse was quite\\nat ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys\\nand the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,\\nremoved the chief of even Emma\\'s vexation.\\n\\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley\\nseemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.\\nInstead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited\\nfor dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as elegant\\nas lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--\\nwanting only to observe enough for Isabella\\'s information--but Miss\\nFairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\\ntalk to her.  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning\\nfrom a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning\\nto rain.  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,\\nand he said,\\n\\n\"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I\\nam sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.\\nI hope you turned directly.\"\\n\\n\"I went only to the post-office,\" said she, \"and reached home\\nbefore the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch\\nthe letters when I am here.  It saves trouble, and is a something\\nto get me out.  A walk before breakfast does me good.\"\\n\\n\"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\"\\n\\n\"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\\n\\n\"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\\nyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;\\nand Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.\\nThe post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.\\nWhen you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are\\nnever worth going through the rain for.\"\\n\\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\\n\\n\"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of\\nevery dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply\\ngrowing older should make me indifferent about letters.\"\\n\\n\"Indifferent!  Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\\npositive curse.\"\\n\\n\"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters\\nof friendship.\"\\n\\n\"I have often thought them the worst of the two,\" replied he coolly.\\n\"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly\\never does.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you are not serious now.  I know Mr. John Knightley too well--\\nI am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as\\nany body.  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you,\\nmuch less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than\\nmyself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.\\nYou have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,\\nnever shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,\\na post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,\\nin worse weather than to-day.\"\\n\\n\"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,\"\\nsaid John Knightley, \"I meant to imply the change of situation\\nwhich time usually brings.  I consider one as including the other.\\nTime will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within\\nthe daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.\\nAs an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten\\nyears hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\"\\n\\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.  A pleasant\\n\"thank you\" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,\\na tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.\\nHer attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,\\naccording to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of\\nhis guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,\\nwas ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,\\n\\n\"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this\\nmorning in the rain.  Young ladies should take care of themselves.--\\nYoung ladies are delicate plants.  They should take care of their\\nhealth and their complexion.  My dear, did you change your stockings?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\\nsolicitude about me.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--\\nI hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.  They are some\\nof my very old friends.  I wish my health allowed me to be a\\nbetter neighbour.  You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.\\nMy daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,\\nand have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel\\nthat he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\\n\\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,\\nand her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office\\nin the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,\\nhow could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there\\nto take care of you.\"\\n\\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\\n\\n\"Oh! do not tell _me_.  You really are a very sad girl, and do not\\nknow how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!\\nMrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?  You and I must positively\\nexert our authority.\"\\n\\n\"My advice,\" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \"I certainly\\ndo feel tempted to give.  Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--\\nLiable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought\\nto be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.\\nThe spring I always think requires more than common care.\\nBetter wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,\\nthan run the risk of bringing on your cough again.  Now do not you\\nfeel that you had?  Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.\\nYou look as if you would not do such a thing again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\" eagerly rejoined\\nMrs. Elton.  \"We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\"--\\nand nodding significantly--\"there must be some arrangement made,\\nthere must indeed.  I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches\\nour letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)\\nshall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.  That will obviate\\nall difficulties you know; and from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane,\\nyou can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.\"\\n\\n\"You are extremely kind,\" said Jane; \"but I cannot give up my\\nearly walk.  I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,\\nI must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon\\nmy word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, say no more about it.  The thing is determined,\\nthat is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine\\nany thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.  You know,\\nMrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.\\nBut I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely\\nworn out.  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,\\nconsider that point as settled.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Jane earnestly, \"I cannot by any means consent\\nto such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.\\nIf the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it\\nalways is when I am not here, by my grandmama\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness\\nto employ our men.\"\\n\\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead\\nof answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\\n\\n\"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!\" said she.--\\n\"The regularity and despatch of it!  If one thinks of all that it\\nhas to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly very well regulated.\"\\n\\n\"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  So seldom\\nthat a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing\\nabout the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,\\nI suppose, actually lost!  And when one considers the variety\\nof hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,\\nit increases the wonder.\"\\n\\n\"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some\\nquickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you\\nwant any farther explanation,\" continued he, smiling, \"they are\\npaid for it.  That is the key to a great deal of capacity.\\nThe public pays and must be served well.\"\\n\\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\\nobservations made.\\n\\n\"I have heard it asserted,\" said John Knightley, \"that the same\\nsort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the\\nsame master teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason,\\nI should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,\\nfor boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble\\ninto any hand they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write\\nvery much alike.  I have not always known their writing apart.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said his brother hesitatingly, \"there is a likeness.\\nI know what you mean--but Emma\\'s hand is the strongest.\"\\n\\n\"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,\" said Mr. Woodhouse;\\n\"and always did.  And so does poor Mrs. Weston\"--with half a sigh\\nand half a smile at her.\\n\\n\"I never saw any gentleman\\'s handwriting\"--Emma began, looking also\\nat Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was\\nattending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,\\n\"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking\\nhis name at once before all these people?  Is it necessary\\nfor me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--\\nyour correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,\\nif I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the\\nsmallest distress.  I certainly get better and better.--Now for it.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\"Mr. Frank Churchill\\nwrites one of the best gentleman\\'s hands I ever saw.\"\\n\\n\"I do not admire it,\" said Mr. Knightley.  \"It is too small--\\nwants strength.  It is like a woman\\'s writing.\"\\n\\nThis was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him\\nagainst the base aspersion.  \"No, it by no means wanted strength--\\nit was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.\\nHad not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?\"  No, she had\\nheard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put\\nit away.\\n\\n\"If we were in the other room,\" said Emma, \"if I had my writing-desk,\\nI am sure I could produce a specimen.  I have a note of his.--\\nDo not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you\\none day?\"\\n\\n\"He chose to say he was employed\"--\\n\\n\"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner\\nto convince Mr. Knightley.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley dryly, \"writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,\\nhe will, of course, put forth his best.\"\\n\\nDinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,\\nwas ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request\\nto be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\\n\\n\"Must I go first?  I really am ashamed of always leading the way.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know\\nwhether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.  She suspected\\nthat it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered\\nbut in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,\\nand that it had not been in vain.  She thought there was an air\\nof greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.\\n\\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition\\nand the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue\\'s end--\\nbut she abstained.  She was quite determined not to utter a word\\nthat should hurt Jane Fairfax\\'s feelings; and they followed\\nthe other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance\\nof good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--\\nwith so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton\\nengross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.  She and Mrs. Weston were\\nobliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.\\nMrs. Elton left them no choice.  If Jane repressed her for a\\nlittle time, she soon began again; and though much that passed\\nbetween them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton\\'s side,\\nthere was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:\\nThe post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,\\nwere long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must\\nbe at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had\\nyet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of\\nMrs. Elton\\'s meditated activity.\\n\\n\"Here is April come!\" said she, \"I get quite anxious about you.\\nJune will soon be here.\"\\n\\n\"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked\\nforward to the summer in general.\"\\n\\n\"But have you really heard of nothing?\"\\n\\n\"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware\\nof the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.\"\\n\\n\"I not aware!\" said Jane, shaking her head; \"dear Mrs. Elton,\\nwho can have thought of it as I have done?\"\\n\\n\"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.  You do not\\nknow how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations.\\nI saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.\\nA cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity\\nof applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,\\nfor she moves in the first circle.  Wax-candles in the schoolroom!\\nYou may imagine how desirable!  Of all houses in the kingdom\\nMrs. Bragge\\'s is the one I would most wish to see you in.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,\"\\nsaid Jane.  \"I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will\\nwant it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself.\\nBut I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries\\nat present.\"\\n\\n\"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.  You are afraid of giving\\nme trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can\\nhardly be more interested about you than I am.  I shall write\\nto Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict\\ncharge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject\\nto her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving\\nany body trouble.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,\\nand June, or say even July, is very near, with such business\\nto accomplish before us.  Your inexperience really amuses me!\\nA situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you,\\nis no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment\\'s notice;\\nindeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, ma\\'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.\\nWhen I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid\\nof being long unemployed.  There are places in town, offices,\\nwhere inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--\\nnot quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, human flesh!  You quite shock me; if you mean a fling\\nat the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather\\na friend to the abolition.\"\\n\\n\"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\" replied Jane;\\n\"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;\\nwidely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;\\nbut as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where\\nit lies.  But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,\\nand that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon\\nmeeting with something that would do.\"\\n\\n\"Something that would do!\" repeated Mrs. Elton.  \"Aye, _that_ may\\nsuit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature\\nyou are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up\\nwith any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,\\nin a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command\\nthe elegancies of life.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,\\nI think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\\nA gentleman\\'s family is all that I should condition for.\"\\n\\n\"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I\\nshall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will\\nbe quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right\\nto move in the first circle.  Your musical knowledge alone would\\nentitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,\\nand mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--\\nif you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;\\nbut you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,\\neven without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must\\nand shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before\\nthe Campbells or I have any rest.\"\\n\\n\"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort\\nof such a situation together,\" said Jane, \"they are pretty sure\\nto be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing\\nto be attempted at present for me.  I am exceedingly obliged to you,\\nMrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am\\nquite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.\\nFor two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as\\nI am.\"\\n\\n\"And I am quite serious too, I assure you,\" replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\\n\"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends\\nto watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\"\\n\\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing\\ntill Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change\\nof object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\\n\\n\"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\\nhe is;--I assure you I like him excessively.  I admire all that quaint,\\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\\nmodern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,\\nI wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.  Oh!  I assure\\nyou I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.\\nI fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.\\nHow do you like it?--Selina\\'s choice--handsome, I think, but I\\ndo not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest\\ndislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.\\nI must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me.\\nA bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste\\nis all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely\\npreferable to finery.  But I am quite in the minority, I believe;\\nfew people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery\\nare every thing.  I have some notion of putting such a trimming\\nas this to my white and silver poplin.  Do you think it will\\nlook well?\"\\n\\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room\\nwhen Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.  He had returned\\nto a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.\\nHe had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--\\nbut there was great joy.  Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see\\nhim now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.  John Knightley\\nonly was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent\\nhis evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,\\nshould set off again, and walk half a mile to another man\\'s house,\\nfor the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing\\nhis day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,\\nwas a circumstance to strike him deeply.  A man who had been in motion\\nsince eight o\\'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,\\nwho had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been\\nin more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,\\nto quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,\\nand on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into\\nthe world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\\nback his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley\\nlooked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,\\n\"I could not have believed it even of _him_.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation\\nhe was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all\\nthe right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere\\nfrom home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;\\nand having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,\\nconvincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants\\nhad been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,\\nwas proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally\\naddressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being\\nhighly interesting to every body in the room.  He gave her a letter,\\nit was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,\\nand had taken the liberty of opening it.\\n\\n\"Read it, read it,\" said he, \"it will give you pleasure;\\nonly a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.\"\\n\\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling\\nand talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,\\nbut very audible to every body.\\n\\n\"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.  Well, what do\\nyou say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,\\ndid not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would\\nnot believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;\\nfor _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is\\nto be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.\\nAs to her illness, all nothing of course.  But it is an excellent\\nthing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.  They will stay\\na good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.\\nThis is precisely what I wanted.  Well, pretty good news, is not it?\\nHave you finished it?  Has Emma read it all?  Put it up, put it up;\\nwe will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not\\ndo now.  I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a\\ncommon way.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion.\\nHer looks and words had nothing to restrain them.  She was happy,\\nshe knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy.\\nHer congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak\\nso fluently.  _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,\\nand trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she\\nrather thought was considerable.\\n\\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\\n\\nIt was well that he took every body\\'s joy for granted, or he\\nmight not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley\\nparticularly delighted.  They were the first entitled,\\nafter Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would\\nhave proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation\\nwith John Knightley, that it would have been too positive\\nan interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and\\nher attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\n\"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\"\\nsaid Mr. Weston.\\n\\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\\nher by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\\n\\n\"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\" he continued--\\n\"and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.\\nI am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we\\nshall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\\nHe is to be in town next week, if not sooner.  We have notice of it\\nin a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,\\nand seeing my son\\'s hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed\\nto me--it was to Mrs. Weston.  She is his principal correspondent,\\nI assure you.  I hardly ever get a letter.\"\\n\\n\"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!  Oh!  Mr. Weston--\\n(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous\\nprecedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow\\nyour example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,\\nwe married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!  Mr. Weston,\\nI could not have believed it of you!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, we men are sad fellows.  You must take care of yourself,\\nMrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in\\na hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all\\ncoming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill\\'s account--she has\\nnot been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--\\nso they are all to move southward without loss of time.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.  Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London.\\na considerable journey.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.  Sixty-five miles farther\\nthan from Maple Grove to London.  But what is distance, Mr. Weston,\\nto people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,\\nMr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.  You will hardly believe me--\\nbut twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again\\nwith four horses.\"\\n\\n\"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,\" said Mr. Weston, \"is, that\\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\\nsofa for a week together.  In Frank\\'s last letter she complained,\\nhe said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\nboth his arm and his uncle\\'s! This, you know, speaks a great degree\\nof weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she\\nmeans to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.\\nCertainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,\\nMrs. Elton.  You must grant me that.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.  I Always take the part\\nof my own sex.  I do indeed.  I give you notice--You will find me\\na formidable antagonist on that point.  I always stand up for women--\\nand I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect\\nto sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill\\'s\\nmaking incredible exertions to avoid it.  Selina says it is quite\\nhorror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety.\\nShe always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.\\nDoes Mrs. Churchill do the same?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other\\nfine lady ever did.  Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady\\nin the land for\"--\\n\\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.  Selina is no fine lady,\\nI assure you.  Do not run away with such an idea.\"\\n\\n\"Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is\\nas thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.\"\\n\\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister\\nwas _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence\\nof it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,\\nwhen Mr. Weston went on.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--\\nbut this is quite between ourselves.  She is very fond of Frank,\\nand therefore I would not speak ill of her.  Besides, she is out of\\nhealth now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been.\\nI would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much\\nfaith in Mrs. Churchill\\'s illness.\"\\n\\n\"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,\\nor to Clifton?\"  \"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too\\ncold for her.  The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.\\nShe has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever\\nwas before, and she begins to want change.  It is a retired place.\\nA fine place, but very retired.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.  Nothing can stand more retired from\\nthe road than Maple Grove.  Such an immense plantation all round it!\\nYou seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--\\nAnd Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina\\nto enjoy that sort of seclusion.  Or, perhaps she may not have\\nresources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.\\nI always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel\\nvery thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent\\nof society.\"\\n\\n\"Frank was here in February for a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"So I remember to have heard.  He will find an _addition_ to the\\nsociety of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume\\nto call myself an addition.  But perhaps he may never have heard\\nof there being such a creature in the world.\"\\n\\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,\\nand Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\\n\\n\"My dear madam!  Nobody but yourself could imagine such a\\nthing possible.  Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston\\'s\\nletters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.\"\\n\\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\\n\\n\"When Frank left us,\" continued he, \"it was quite uncertain when we\\nmight see him again, which makes this day\\'s news doubly welcome.\\nIt has been completely unexpected.  That is, _I_ always had a strong\\npersuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something\\nfavourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.  He and Mrs. Weston\\nwere both dreadfully desponding.  `How could he contrive to come?\\nAnd how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare\\nhim again?\\' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen\\nin our favour; and so it has, you see.  I have observed, Mrs. Elton,\\nin the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,\\nthey are sure to mend the next.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.  It is just what I used\\nto say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,\\nwhen, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all\\nthe rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,\\nand exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before\\nHymen\\'s saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have\\nbeen at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!\\nThe carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,\\nI remember, he came to me quite in despair.\"\\n\\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\\nseized the opportunity of going on.\\n\\n\"You were mentioning May.  May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\\nis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place\\nthan Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the\\nagreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--\\nprecisely the season of the year which one should have chosen\\nfor it:  days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,\\nalways inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.  When he\\nwas here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal\\nof wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,\\nand we could not do half that we intended.  Now will be the time.\\nThis will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,\\nwhether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant\\nexpectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,\\nand at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having\\nhim actually in the house.  I think it is so.  I think it is the\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you\\nwill be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.\\nHe is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.\\nMrs. Weston\\'s partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,\\nmost gratifying to me.  She thinks nobody equal to him.\"\\n\\n\"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my\\nopinion will be decidedly in his favour.  I have heard so much\\nin praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair\\nto observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,\\nand are by no means implicitly guided by others.  I give you notice\\nthat as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston was musing.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said he presently, \"I have not been severe upon poor\\nMrs. Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;\\nbut there are some traits in her character which make it difficult\\nfor me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.\\nYou cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,\\nnor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,\\nthe whole blame of it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator.\\nFrank\\'s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her.\\nMr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife\\'s:\\nhis is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would\\nharm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;\\nbut her pride is arrogance and insolence!  And what inclines one less\\nto bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody\\nwhen he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever\\nsince her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill\\'d them\\nall in high and mighty claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is\\nan upstart.\"\\n\\n\"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite\\na horror of upstarts.  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust\\nto people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood\\nwho are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs\\nthey give themselves!  Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me\\nthink of them directly.  People of the name of Tupman, very lately\\nsettled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving\\nthemselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old\\nestablished families.  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can\\nhave lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.\\nThey came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,\\nyou know, Mr. Weston.  One has not great hopes from Birmingham.\\nI always say there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing\\nmore is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things\\nI assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently\\nthink themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens\\nto be one of their nearest neighbours.  It is infinitely too bad.\\nMr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,\\nand whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am\\nalmost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before\\nhis death.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted.  Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,\\nhaving said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of\\nwalking away.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse\\nto cards.  The remaining five were left to their own powers,\\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,\\nwhich nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself\\nin a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.\\nHe was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\\n\\n\"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about\\nthe boys; but you have your sister\\'s letter, and every thing is\\ndown at full length there we may be sure.  My charge would be much\\nmore concise than her\\'s, and probably not much in the same spirit;\\nall that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,\\nand do not physic them.\"\\n\\n\"I rather hope to satisfy you both,\" said Emma, \"for I shall do all\\nin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;\\nand happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\"\\n\\n\"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\"\\n\\n\"That is very likely.  You think so, do not you?\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--\\nor even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements\\ncontinue to increase as much as they have done lately.\"\\n\\n\"Increase!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made\\na great difference in your way of life.\"\\n\\n\"Difference!  No indeed I am not.\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\\nthan you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come\\ndown for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--\\nWhen did it happen before, or any thing like it?  Your neighbourhood\\nis increasing, and you mix more with it.  A little while ago,\\nevery letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;\\ndinners at Mr. Cole\\'s, or balls at the Crown.  The difference\\nwhich Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said his brother quickly, \"it is Randalls that does it all.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\\nthat Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.  And if they are,\\nI only beg you to send them home.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Mr. Knightley, \"that need not be the consequence.\\nLet them be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Emma, \"you amuse me!  I should like to know\\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\\nof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\\nto attend to the little boys.  These amazing engagements of mine--\\nwhat have they been?  Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball\\ntalked of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at\\nMr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of\\nyour friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.\\nBut you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom\\nI am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a\\nseries of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear\\nlittle boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,\\nI do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,\\nwho is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--\\nand who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling\\nhis accounts.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded\\nwithout difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton\\'s beginning to talk to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME III\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.\\nShe was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at\\nall apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.  Her own attachment\\nhad really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--\\nbut if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love\\nof the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment\\nwhich he had taken away, it would be very distressing.  If a separation\\nof two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils\\nbefore her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.\\nShe did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,\\nand it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\\n\\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!\\nand yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.\\nShe felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,\\nan event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.\\n\\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill\\'s\\nfeelings.  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had\\nbeen imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.  He rode\\ndown for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came\\nfrom Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all\\nher quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,\\nand how she must act.  They met with the utmost friendliness.\\nThere could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her.\\nBut she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\\nhad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.\\nShe watched him well.  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he\\nhad been.  Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,\\nhad produced this very natural and very desirable effect.\\n\\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories:\\nand he was not without agitation.  It was not in his calmness that\\nshe read his comparative difference.  He was not calm; his spirits\\nwere evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.\\nLively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;\\nbut what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a\\nquarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.\\n\"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--\\nhe had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he\\nhad the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,\\nand much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\"\\nShe had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his\\nagitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;\\nand she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her\\nreturning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself\\nwith her long.\\n\\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\\nHe was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.\\nHis aunt could not bear to have him leave her.  Such was his own account\\nat Randall\\'s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,\\nit was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill\\'s removal to London had\\nbeen of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.\\nThat she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself\\nconvinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could\\nnot doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state\\nof health than she had been half a year ago.  He did not believe it\\nto proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,\\nor at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;\\nbut he could not be prevailed on, by all his father\\'s doubts, to say\\nthat her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong\\nas ever.\\n\\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could\\nnot endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation\\nand suffering; and by the ten days\\' end, her nephew\\'s letter to\\nRandalls communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove\\nimmediately to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended\\nto the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise\\na fancy for the place.  A ready-furnished house in a favourite\\nspot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.\\n\\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two\\nmonths before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--\\nfor the house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now\\nhe wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,\\nalmost as often as he could even wish.\\n\\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.  He was\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.\\nShe hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof.\\n\\nMr. Weston\\'s own happiness was indisputable.  He was quite delighted.\\nIt was the very circumstance he could have wished for.  Now, it would\\nbe really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles\\nto a young man?--An hour\\'s ride.  He would be always coming over.\\nThe difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough\\nto make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing\\nhim never.  Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen\\nto Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.  Were he ever able\\nto get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.\\nThere was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be\\nat Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.\\nBetter than nearer!\\n\\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--\\nthe ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before, but it had\\nbeen soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.  Now, however,\\nit was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon\\nafter the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,\\nto say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,\\nand that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four\\nhours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\\n\\nMr. Weston\\'s ball was to be a real thing.  A very few to-morrows\\nstood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned.  The time of year lightened the evil\\nto him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates\\nwas engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,\\nand he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear\\nlittle John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear\\nEmma were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.  The day approached,\\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,\\nFrank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\\nbefore dinner, and every thing was safe.\\n\\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.\\nThe room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better\\nthan a common meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very\\nearnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible\\nafter themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the\\npropriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,\\nthat she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet\\ninterval in the young man\\'s company.  She was to convey Harriet,\\nand they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just\\nsufficiently before them.\\n\\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though\\nhe did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have\\na delightful evening.  They all walked about together, to see\\nthat every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes\\nwere joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma\\ncould not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.\\n\"So unreasonably early!\" she was going to exclaim; but she presently\\nfound that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,\\nby particular desire, to help Mr. Weston\\'s judgment; and they were\\nso very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been\\nentreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,\\non the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might\\nsoon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.\\n\\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which\\nMr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and\\nintimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,\\nwas not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.\\nShe liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness\\nwould have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,\\nbut not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--\\nShe could fancy such a man.  The whole party walked about,\\nand looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,\\nformed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_,\\na fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\\n\\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston\\'s fault that the number\\nof privy councillors was not yet larger.  They had stopped\\nat Mrs. Bates\\'s door to offer the use of their carriage,\\nbut the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.\\n\\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going\\nto the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--\\nimpatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was spoken of.  \"I think she must be here soon,\" said he.\\n\"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much\\nof her.  It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\"\\n\\nA carriage was heard.  He was on the move immediately;\\nbut coming back, said,\\n\\n\"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.  I have never seen\\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton.  I have no business to put myself forward.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.\\n\\n\"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about.\\n\"We thought you were to bring them.\"\\n\\nThe mistake had been slight.  The carriage was sent for them now.\\nEmma longed to know what Frank\\'s first opinion of Mrs. Elton\\nmight be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,\\nand her smiles of graciousness.  He was immediately qualifying\\nhimself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,\\nafter the introduction had passed.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\\n\"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father:\\n\"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\"  and away he went.  Mr. Weston\\nwas following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her\\nopinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young\\nman himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out\\nof hearing.\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told\\nyou I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am\\nextremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.  I never compliment.\\nI think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely\\nwhat I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least\\nconceit or puppyism.  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--\\nquite a horror of them.  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.\\nNeither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we\\nused sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost\\nto a fault, bore with them much better.\"\\n\\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston\\'s attention was chained;\\nbut when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were\\nladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must\\nhurry away.\\n\\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.  \"I have no doubt of its being\\nour carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.  Our coachman and horses are\\nso extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--\\nWhat a pleasure it is to send one\\'s carriage for a friend!--\\nI understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it\\nwill be quite unnecessary.  You may be very sure I shall always\\ntake care of _them_.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,\\nwalked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much\\nher duty as Mrs. Weston\\'s to receive them.  Her gestures and\\nmovements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;\\nbut her words, every body\\'s words, were soon lost under the\\nincessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not\\nfinished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted\\ninto the circle at the fire.  As the door opened she was heard,\\n\\n\"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.  Nothing to signify.\\nI do not care for myself.  Quite thick shoes.  And Jane declares--\\nWell!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!  This is brilliant\\nindeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.\\nNothing wanting.  Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--\\nJane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?  Oh!  Mr. Weston,\\nyou must really have had Aladdin\\'s lamp.  Good Mrs. Stokes\\nwould not know her own room again.  I saw her as I came in;\\nshe was standing in the entrance.  `Oh!  Mrs. Stokes,\\' said I--\\nbut I had not time for more.\"  She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--\\n\"Very well, I thank you, ma\\'am. I hope you are quite well.\\nVery happy to hear it.  So afraid you might have a headache!--\\nseeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.\\nDelighted to hear it indeed.  Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged\\nto you for the carriage!--excellent time.  Jane and I quite ready.\\nDid not keep the horses a moment.  Most comfortable carriage.--\\nOh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.\\nMrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--\\nBut two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.\\nI said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma\\'am--.\\'  Thank you, my mother\\nis remarkably well.  Gone to Mr. Woodhouse\\'s. I made her take\\nher shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\\nMrs. Dixon\\'s wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\\nBought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon\\'s choice.  There were\\nthree others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.\\nColonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.  My dear Jane,\\nare you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,\\nbut I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--\\nand there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his\\nextreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you\\nmy mother\\'s spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet\\nnever came out again.  My mother often talks of your good-nature.\\nDoes not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--\\nAh! here\\'s Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--\\nVery well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--\\nSuch a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma\\nmost complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,\\nyou do look--how do you like Jane\\'s hair?--You are a judge.--\\nShe did it all herself.  Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--\\nNo hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--\\nand Mrs. Hughes.  Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for\\na moment.--How do you do?  How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.\\nThis is delightful, is not it?--Where\\'s dear Mr. Richard?--\\nOh! there he is.  Don\\'t disturb him.  Much better employed talking\\nto the young ladies.  How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the\\nother day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--\\nand good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host\\nof friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do\\nyou all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.  Never better.--\\nDon\\'t I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the\\nworthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about\\namong such friends!  And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.\\nNo coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea\\nif you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\\nEvery thing so good!\"\\n\\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\\ndiscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little\\nway behind her.--He was thoughtful.  Whether he were overhearing too,\\nshe could not determine.  After a good many compliments to Jane\\non her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,\\nMrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--\\nand it was, \"How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--\\nHow has Wright done my hair?\"--with many other relative questions,\\nall answered with patient politeness.  Mrs. Elton then said,\\n\"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such\\nan occasion as this, when every body\\'s eyes are so much upon me,\\nand in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving\\nthis ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior\\nto others.  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--\\nSo Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see\\nif our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\\nI like him very well.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could\\nnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want\\nto hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,\\ntill another suspension brought Mrs. Elton\\'s tones again distinctly\\nforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\\n\\n\"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--\\nI was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be\\nimpatient for tidings of us.\"\\n\\n\"Jane!\"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--\\n\"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"How do you like Mrs. Elton?\" said Emma in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"You are ungrateful.\"\\n\\n\"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?\"  Then changing from a frown to\\na smile--\"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--\\nWhere is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\"\\n\\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.\\nHe walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity,\\nwhich must be laid before Emma.  It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston\\nthat Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would\\nexpect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma\\nthat distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.\\n\\n\"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\" said Mr. Weston.\\n\"She will think Frank ought to ask her.\"\\n\\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;\\nand boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\\nperfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\\nwanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\\nwas to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--\\nMr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\\nWoodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.\\nIt was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had\\nundoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;\\nfor though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could\\nnot lose by the change.  Mr. Weston might be his son\\'s superior.--\\nIn spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,\\ndelighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,\\nand to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--\\nShe was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley\\'s not dancing than by any\\nthing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not\\nto be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,\\nand fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest\\nin the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--\\nHe could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,\\nthan where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright figure,\\namong the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,\\nwas such as Emma felt must draw every body\\'s eyes; and, excepting her\\nown partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men\\nwho could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike\\na manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he\\nbut take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him\\nto smile; but in general he was looking grave.  She wished he could\\nlove a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--\\nHe seemed often observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he\\nthought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,\\nshe did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between\\nher and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,\\nthan lovers.  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,\\nwas indubitable.\\n\\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant\\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body\\nseemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,\\nwhich is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,\\nwas repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.\\nOf very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive\\nthan such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma\\nthought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,\\nand Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--\\nand so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there\\ncould be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma\\'s wonder\\nlessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.\\nHe would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:\\nshe was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to\\nescape into the card-room.\\n\\nEscape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room\\nwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about\\nin front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution\\nof maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly\\nbefore Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--\\nEmma saw it.  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way\\nup from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,\\nand by only turning her head a little she saw it all.  When she was\\nhalf-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she\\nwould no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,\\nthat she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took\\nplace between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,\\nwho was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,\\nbut even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,\\ngentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, \"Do not\\nyou dance, Mr. Elton?\" to which his prompt reply was, \"Most readily,\\nMrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\"\\n\\n\"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.\\nI am no dancer.\"\\n\\n\"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\" said he, \"I shall have great pleasure,\\nI am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man,\\nand that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great\\npleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\"\\n\"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--\\nand if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,\\nMrs. Weston.  You will excuse me.  Any thing else I should be most happy\\nto do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what\\nsurprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat.\\nThis was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--\\nShe looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a\\nlittle distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,\\nwhile smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.\\n\\nShe would not look again.  Her heart was in a glow, and she feared\\nher face might be as hot.\\n\\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley\\nleading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,\\nseldom more delighted, than at that instant.  She was all pleasure\\nand gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be\\nthanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance\\nsaid much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.\\n\\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,\\nextremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,\\nif it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for\\nthe very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction\\nwhich her happy features announced.  It was not thrown away on her,\\nshe bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,\\nand was in a continual course of smiles.\\n\\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)\\nvery foolish.  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,\\nthough growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings,\\nby observing audibly to her partner,\\n\\n\"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,\\nI declare.\"\\n\\nSupper was announced.  The move began; and Miss Bates might be\\nheard from that moment, without interruption, till her being\\nseated at table and taking up her spoon.\\n\\n\"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.\\nMrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid\\nthere will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has\\nbeen done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,\\nindeed you must.  Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!\\nHow well you put it on!--so gratified!  Excellent dancing indeed!--\\nYes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama\\nto bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without\\nsaying a word, just as I told you.  Grandmama was quite well,\\nhad a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,\\nand backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples\\nand wine before she came away:  amazing luck in some of her throws:\\nand she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,\\nand who were your partners.  `Oh!\\' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane;\\nI left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you\\nall about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\\nI do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.\\'\\nMy dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would\\nnot rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,\\nJane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand\\na little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant\\nshe looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.\\nQuite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.\\nTwo steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is\\nbut one.  Well, I was persuaded there were two.  How very odd!\\nI was convinced there were two, and there is but one.  I never saw any\\nthing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\\nyou of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--\\nThe baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;\\nbut there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus\\nbrought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the\\nasparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.  Now there\\nis nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--\\nso she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it\\nto any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,\\nwho would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!\\nI am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such\\nelegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--\\nWell, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?  Anywhere, so that\\nJane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\\nOh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--\\nonly it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you direct\\nin this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever\\nrecollect half the dishes for grandmama?  Soup too!  Bless me!\\nI should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I\\ncannot help beginning.\"\\n\\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till\\nafter supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,\\nher eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.\\nHe was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton\\'s conduct; it had been\\nunpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton\\'s looks also received the due\\nshare of censure.\\n\\n\"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\" said he.  \"Emma, why\\nis it that they are your enemies?\"\\n\\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving\\nno answer, added, \"_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,\\nwhatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;\\nbut confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I did,\" replied Emma, \"and they cannot forgive me.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,\\nand he only said,\\n\\n\"I shall not scold you.  I leave you to your own reflections.\"\\n\\n\"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever\\ntell me I am wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads\\nyou wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.\"\\n\\n\"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.\\nThere is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I\\ndid not:  and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.\\nIt was through a series of strange blunders!\"\\n\\n\"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice\\nto say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for\\nhimself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton\\nis totally without.  An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--\\ninfinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such\\na woman as Mrs. Elton.  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\"\\n\\nEmma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle\\nof Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\\n\\n\"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--\\nCome Emma, set your companions the example.  Every body is lazy!\\nEvery body is asleep!\"\\n\\n\"I am ready,\" said Emma, \"whenever I am wanted.\"\\n\\n\"Whom are you going to dance with?\" asked Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, \"With you, if you will\\nask me.\"\\n\\n\"Will you?\" said he, offering his hand.\\n\\n\"Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we\\nare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\"\\n\\n\"Brother and sister! no, indeed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\\npleasure.  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,\\nwhich she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was\\nextremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting\\nthe Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so\\nmuch alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,\\nwas peculiarly gratifying.  The impertinence of the Eltons, which for\\na few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been\\nthe occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked\\nforward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet\\'s infatuation.--\\nFrom Harriet\\'s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they\\nquitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes\\nwere suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton\\nwas not the superior creature she had believed him.  The fever\\nwas over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being\\nquickened again by injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil\\nfeelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed\\nneglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,\\nFrank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not\\nwanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!\\n\\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told\\nher that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping\\nat Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.\\nShe did not regret it.\\n\\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\\nto rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\\nfor the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\\nwhen the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered\\nwhom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,\\nwith Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment\\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\\nHarriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--\\nThe iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--\\nthey were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking\\ninto a chair fainted away.\\n\\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\\nand surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting,\\nbut the suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma\\nacquainted with the whole.\\n\\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at\\nMrs. Goddard\\'s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,\\nand taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public\\nenough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile\\nbeyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms\\non each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;\\nand when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,\\nthey had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,\\non a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.\\nA child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,\\nexcessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet\\nto follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,\\nand made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\\nBut poor Harriet could not follow.  She had suffered very much\\nfrom cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--\\nand in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged\\nto remain.\\n\\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been\\nmore courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack\\ncould not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a\\ndozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,\\nand impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and\\nmore frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out\\nher purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,\\nor to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,\\nand was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,\\nand she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,\\ndemanding more.\\n\\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling\\nand conditioning, they loud and insolent.  By a most fortunate\\nchance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him\\nto her assistance at this critical moment.  The pleasantness\\nof the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his\\nhorses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--\\nand happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before\\nof Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had\\nbeen obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:\\nhe was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,\\nwas unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.\\nThe terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet\\nwas then their own portion.  He had left them completely frightened;\\nand Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,\\nhad just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits\\nwere quite overcome.  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:\\nhe had thought of no other place.\\n\\nThis was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and\\nof Harriet\\'s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--\\nHe dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays\\nleft him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give\\nassurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there\\nbeing such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,\\nhe set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter\\nfor her friend and herself.\\n\\nSuch an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young\\nwoman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting\\ncertain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.\\nSo Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,\\ncould even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their\\nappearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling\\nthat circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting\\nto each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,\\nbe on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such\\na groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.\\n\\nIt was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;\\nno rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened\\nto the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very\\nperson was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly\\nwas very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable\\nstate of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.\\nHe was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,\\nshe just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.  It seemed as if\\nevery thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.\\nIt was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly\\nrecommending each to the other.\\n\\nIn the few minutes\\' conversation which she had yet had with him,\\nwhile Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\\nher naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet\\'s\\nown account had been given, he had expressed his indignation\\nat the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.\\nEvery thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled\\nnor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.\\nNo, she had had enough of interference.  There could be no harm\\nin a scheme, a mere passive scheme.  It was no more than a wish.\\nBeyond it she would on no account proceed.\\n\\nEmma\\'s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge\\nof what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion:\\nbut she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.  Within half\\nan hour it was known all over Highbury.  It was the very event\\nto engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all\\nthe youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of\\nfrightful news.  The last night\\'s ball seemed lost in the gipsies.\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,\\nwould scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go\\nbeyond the shrubbery again.  It was some comfort to him that many\\ninquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours\\nknew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith,\\nwere coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure\\nof returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--\\nwhich, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.\\nShe had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such\\na man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not\\ninvent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\\n\\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\\nthemselves off in a hurry.  The young ladies of Highbury might have\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole\\nhistory dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma\\nand her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground,\\nand Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of\\nHarriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right\\nif she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came\\none morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after\\nsitting down and hesitating, thus began:\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I\\nshould like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,\\nyou know, it will be over.\"\\n\\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.\\nThere was a seriousness in Harriet\\'s manner which prepared her,\\nquite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.\\n\\n\"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\" she continued,\\n\"to have no reserves with you on this subject.  As I am happily\\nquite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you\\nshould have the satisfaction of knowing it.  I do not want to say\\nmore than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way\\nas I have done, and I dare say you understand me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Emma, \"I hope I do.\"\\n\\n\"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . .\"\\ncried Harriet, warmly.  \"It seems like madness!  I can see nothing\\nat all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet\\nhim or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--\\nand indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do\\nnot envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,\\nas I have done:  she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,\\nbut I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget\\nher look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nI wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\\nit will not give me another moment\\'s pang:  and to convince you\\nthat I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I\\nought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--\\nI know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I\\nwill destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it\\nin your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.\\nCannot you guess what this parcel holds?\" said she, with a conscious look.\\n\\n\"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\"\\n\\n\"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have\\nvalued very much.\"\\n\\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top.  Her curiosity was greatly excited.\\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.\\nWithin abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\\nwhich Harriet opened:  it was well lined with the softest cotton;\\nbut, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Harriet, \"you _must_ recollect.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed I do not.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!  I should not have thought it possible you could forget\\nwhat passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very\\nlast times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I\\nhad my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--\\nI think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger\\nwith your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--\\nBut, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired\\nme to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;\\nbut it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept\\nplaying some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.\\nAnd so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--\\nso I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then\\nas a great treat.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Harriet!\" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\\nand jumping up, \"you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\\nRemember it?  Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving\\nthis relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting\\nthe finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\\nabout me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in\\nmy pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a\\ncontinual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--\\ngo on--what else?\"\\n\\n\"And had you really some at hand yourself?  I am sure I never\\nsuspected it, you did it so naturally.\"\\n\\n\"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\"\\nsaid Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\nbetween wonder and amusement.  And secretly she added to herself,\\n\"Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton\\na piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!\\nI never was equal to this.\"\\n\\n\"Here,\" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \"here is\\nsomething still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable,\\nbecause this is what did really once belong to him, which the\\ncourt-plaister never did.\"\\n\\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.  It was the end\\nof an old pencil,--the part without any lead.\\n\\n\"This was really his,\" said Harriet.--\"Do not you remember\\none morning?--no, I dare say you do not.  But one morning--I forget\\nexactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before\\n_that_ _evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;\\nit was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him\\nsomething about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;\\nbut when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he\\nsoon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,\\nand this was left upon the table as good for nothing.  But I kept\\nmy eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never\\nparted with it again from that moment.\"\\n\\n\"I do remember it,\" cried Emma; \"I perfectly remember it.--\\nTalking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\\nliked it, and Mr. Elton\\'s seeming resolved to learn to like it too.\\nI perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,\\nwas not he?  I have an idea he was standing just here.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!  I do not know.  I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,\\nbut I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,\\nmuch about where I am now.\"--\\n\\n\"Well, go on.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that\\'s all.  I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--\\nexcept that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,\\nand I wish you to see me do it.\"\\n\\n\"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness\\nin treasuring up these things?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish\\nI could forget as easily as I can burn them.  It was very wrong\\nof me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.\\nI knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them.\"\\n\\n\"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have\\nnot a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister\\nmight be useful.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be happier to burn it,\" replied Harriet.  \"It has\\na disagreeable look to me.  I must get rid of every thing.--\\nThere it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\"\\n\\n\"And when,\" thought Emma, \"will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\"\\n\\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\\nalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\\n_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet\\'s.--About a\\nfortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,\\nand quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,\\nwhich made the information she received more valuable.\\nShe merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, \"Well, Harriet,\\nwhenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so\"--and thought\\nno more of it, till after a minute\\'s silence she heard Harriet\\nsay in a very serious tone, \"I shall never marry.\"\\n\\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\\nmoment\\'s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\\n\\n\"Never marry!--This is a new resolution.\"\\n\\n\"It is one that I shall never change, however.\"\\n\\nAfter another short hesitation, \"I hope it does not proceed from--\\nI hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton indeed!\" cried Harriet indignantly.--\"Oh! no\"--and Emma\\ncould just catch the words, \"so superior to Mr. Elton!\"\\n\\nShe then took a longer time for consideration.  Should she proceed\\nno farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--\\nPerhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;\\nor perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive\\nHarriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing\\nlike such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent\\ndiscussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--\\nShe believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,\\nall that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best.\\nShe had previously determined how far she would proceed,\\non any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,\\nto have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--\\nShe was decided, and thus spoke--\\n\\n\"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.\\nYour resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,\\nresults from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,\\nwould be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.\\nIs not it so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\\nIndeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him\\nat a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all\\nthe rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,\\nwhich are so proper, in me especially.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.  The service he rendered\\nyou was enough to warm your heart.\"\\n\\n\"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--\\nThe very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--\\nwhen I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.\\nSuch a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery\\nto perfect happiness!\"\\n\\n\"It is very natural.  It is natural, and it is honourable.--\\nYes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--\\nBut that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.\\nI do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.  I do not by any\\nmeans engage for its being returned.  Consider what you are about.\\nPerhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can:\\nat any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded\\nof his liking you.  Be observant of him.  Let his behaviour be the\\nguide of your sensations.  I give you this caution now, because I\\nshall never speak to you again on the subject.  I am determined\\nagainst all interference.  Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.\\nLet no name ever pass our lips.  We were very wrong before;\\nwe will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there\\ndo seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;\\nbut yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have\\nbeen matches of greater disparity.  But take care of yourself.\\nI would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,\\nbe assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste\\nwhich I shall always know how to value.\"\\n\\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.\\nEmma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing\\nfor her friend.  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--\\nand it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened\\nupon Hartfield.  To Highbury in general it brought no material change.\\nThe Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,\\nand of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax\\nwas still at her grandmother\\'s; and as the return of the Campbells\\nfrom Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,\\nfixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,\\nprovided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton\\'s activity\\nin her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful\\nsituation against her will.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\\ntaken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\\nhim more.  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his\\npursuit of Emma.  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\\nEvery thing declared it; his own attentions, his father\\'s hints,\\nhis mother-in-law\\'s guarded silence; it was all in unison;\\nwords, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.\\nBut while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him\\nover to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination\\nto trifle with Jane Fairfax.  He could not understand it; but there\\nwere symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--\\nsymptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,\\nhe could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,\\nhowever he might wish to escape any of Emma\\'s errors of imagination.\\n_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.  He was dining\\nwith the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons\\'; and he had\\nseen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,\\nfrom the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.\\nWhen he was again in their company, he could not help remembering\\nwhat he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it\\nwere like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\\n\\n\"Myself creating what I saw,\"\\n\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something\\nof private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank\\nChurchill and Jane.\\n\\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,\\nto spend his evening at Hartfield.  Emma and Harriet were going\\nto walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a\\nlarger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their\\nexercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston\\nand their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.\\nThey all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it\\nwas exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,\\npressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.  The Randalls\\nparty agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech\\nfrom Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it\\npossible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse\\'s most obliging invitation.\\n\\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.\\nThe gentlemen spoke of his horse.\\n\\n\"By the bye,\" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,\\n\"what became of Mr. Perry\\'s plan of setting up his carriage?\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, \"I did not know that he\\never had any such plan.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, I had it from you.  You wrote me word of it three months ago.\"\\n\\n\"Me! impossible!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you did.  I remember it perfectly.  You mentioned it as\\nwhat was certainly to be very soon.  Mrs. Perry had told somebody,\\nand was extremely happy about it.  It was owing to _her_ persuasion,\\nas she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal\\nof harm.  You must remember it now?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\"\\n\\n\"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must\\nhave dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith,\\nyou walk as if you were tired.  You will not be sorry to find\\nyourself at home.\"\\n\\n\"What is this?--What is this?\" cried Mr. Weston, \"about Perry\\nand a carriage?  Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?\\nI am glad he can afford it.  You had it from himself, had you?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied his son, laughing, \"I seem to have had it\\nfrom nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston\\'s\\nhaving mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,\\nwith all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard\\na syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.  I am\\na great dreamer.  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--\\nand when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin\\ndreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.\"\\n\\n\"It is odd though,\" observed his father, \"that you should have had such\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe.  Perry\\'s setting up his carriage!\\nand his wife\\'s persuading him to it, out of care for his health--\\njust what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;\\nonly a little premature.  What an air of probability sometimes\\nruns through a dream!  And at others, what a heap of absurdities\\nit is!  Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in\\nyour thoughts when you are absent.  Emma, you are a great dreamer,\\nI think?\"\\n\\nEmma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests\\nto prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach\\nof Mr. Weston\\'s hint.\\n\\n\"Why, to own the truth,\" cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\\nto be heard the last two minutes, \"if I must speak on this subject,\\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not\\nmean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes\\nthe oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,\\nI must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;\\nfor Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles\\nknew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret,\\nknown to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.\\nMrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came\\nto my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she\\nhad prevailed.  Jane, don\\'t you remember grandmama\\'s telling us\\nof it when we got home?  I forget where we had been walking to--\\nvery likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls.\\nMrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do\\nnot know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not\\nto go beyond:  and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it\\nto a soul that I know of.  At the same time, I will not positively\\nanswer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do\\nsometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.  I am a talker,\\nyou know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing\\nescape me which I should not.  I am not like Jane; I wish I were.\\nI will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world.\\nWhere is she?--Oh! just behind.  Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry\\'s coming.--\\nExtraordinary dream, indeed!\"\\n\\nThey were entering the hall.  Mr. Knightley\\'s eyes had preceded\\nMiss Bates\\'s in a glance at Jane.  From Frank Churchill\\'s face,\\nwhere he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,\\nhe had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,\\nand too busy with her shawl.  Mr. Weston had walked in.  The two\\nother gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.  Mr. Knightley\\nsuspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--\\nhe seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--\\nJane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.\\n\\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation.  The dream must\\nbe borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\\nthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\\nand which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\\npersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,\\non which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.\\nTea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse,\" said Frank Churchill, after examining a table\\nbehind him, which he could reach as he sat, \"have your nephews taken\\naway their alphabets--their box of letters?  It used to stand here.\\nWhere is it?  This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought\\nto be treated rather as winter than summer.  We had great amusement\\nwith those letters one morning.  I want to puzzle you again.\"\\n\\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves.  They were rapidly forming\\nwords for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.\\nThe quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for\\nMr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,\\nwhich Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily\\noccupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure\\nof the \"poor little boys,\" or in fondly pointing out, as he took\\nup any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\\n\\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.  She gave\\na slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.\\nFrank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley\\nso placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much\\nas he could, with as little apparent observation.  The word\\nwas discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.  If meant\\nto be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,\\nshe should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,\\nfor it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,\\nand finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.\\nShe was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\\nThe word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,\\nthere was a blush on Jane\\'s cheek which gave it a meaning not\\notherwise ostensible.  Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;\\nbut how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.\\nHow the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been\\nso lain asleep!  He feared there must be some decided involvement.\\nDisingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.\\nThese letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.\\nIt was a child\\'s play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\\nChurchill\\'s part.\\n\\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great\\nalarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions.\\nHe saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look\\nsly and demure.  He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found\\nit highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it\\nproper to appear to censure; for she said, \"Nonsense! for shame!\"\\nHe heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,\\n\"I will give it to her--shall I?\"--and as clearly heard Emma\\nopposing it with eager laughing warmth.  \"No, no, you must not;\\nyou shall not, indeed.\"\\n\\nIt was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love\\nwithout feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,\\ndirectly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular\\ndegree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley\\'s\\nexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize\\nevery possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was\\nnot long before he saw it to be _Dixon_.  Jane Fairfax\\'s perception\\nseemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal\\nto the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters\\nso arranged.  She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing\\nherself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,\\nand saying only, \"I did not know that proper names were allowed,\"\\npushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked\\nresolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.\\nHer face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned\\ntowards her aunt.\\n\\n\"Aye, very true, my dear,\" cried the latter, though Jane had not\\nspoken a word--\"I was just going to say the same thing.  It is time\\nfor us to be going indeed.  The evening is closing in, and grandmama\\nwill be looking for us.  My dear sir, you are too obliging.\\nWe really must wish you good night.\"\\n\\nJane\\'s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt\\nhad preconceived.  She was immediately up, and wanting to quit\\nthe table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;\\nand Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously\\npushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.\\nShe was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was\\nlooking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;\\nand how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.\\n\\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full\\nof what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist\\nhis observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--\\nan anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question.\\nHe could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to\\npreserve her.  It was his duty.\\n\\n\"Pray, Emma,\" said he, \"may I ask in what lay the great amusement,\\nthe poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?\\nI saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very\\nentertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other.\"\\n\\nEmma was extremely confused.  She could not endure to give him the\\ntrue explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,\\nshe was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she cried in evident embarrassment, \"it all meant nothing;\\na mere joke among ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"The joke,\" he replied gravely, \"seemed confined to you\\nand Mr. Churchill.\"\\n\\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.  She would\\nrather busy herself about any thing than speak.  He sat a little\\nwhile in doubt.  A variety of evils crossed his mind.  Interference--\\nfruitless interference.  Emma\\'s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy,\\nseemed to declare her affection engaged.  Yet he would speak.\\nHe owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in\\nan unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter\\nany thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\\n\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he at last, with earnest kindness, \"do you\\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between\\nthe gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\"\\n\\n\"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?  Oh! yes, perfectly.--\\nWhy do you make a doubt of it?\"\\n\\n\"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,\\nor that she admired him?\"\\n\\n\"Never, never!\" she cried with a most open eagerness--\"Never, for\\nthe twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.\\nAnd how could it possibly come into your head?\"\\n\\n\"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--\\ncertain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you amuse me excessively.  I am delighted to find that you\\ncan vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--\\nvery sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will\\nnot do.  There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;\\nand the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some\\npeculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--\\nit is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of\\nnonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,\\nwhich is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or\\nadmiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.\\nThat is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I can _answer_ for its\\nbeing so on his.  I will answer for the gentleman\\'s indifference.\"\\n\\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\\nwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley.  She was in gay spirits, and would\\nhave prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars\\nof his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows\\nof a circumstance which highly entertained her:  but his gaiety did\\nnot meet hers.  He found he could not be useful, and his feelings\\nwere too much irritated for talking.  That he might not be irritated\\ninto an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse\\'s tender\\nhabits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon\\nafterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness\\nand solitude of Donwell Abbey.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and\\nMrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.\\nNo such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores\\nat present.  In the daily interchange of news, they must be again\\nrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings\\'\\ncoming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report,\\nand the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped\\nmight eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,\\nas that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed.  It was the delay of a great\\ndeal of pleasure and parade.  Her introductions and recommendations\\nmust all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.\\nSo she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced\\nher that every thing need not be put off.  Why should not they\\nexplore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?  They could\\ngo there again with them in the autumn.  It was settled that they\\nshould go to Box Hill.  That there was to be such a party had been\\nlong generally known:  it had even given the idea of another.\\nEmma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body\\nfound so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither.  Two or three more\\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to\\nbe done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior\\nto the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,\\nand picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.\\n\\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could\\nnot but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing\\nfrom Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her\\nbrother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,\\nand go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded\\nto it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.  Now, as her\\nobjection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,\\nof which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth\\nbringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof\\nto him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found\\nherself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she\\nwould have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of\\nMrs. Elton\\'s party!  Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance\\nof her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity\\nin her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston\\'s temper.\\n\\n\"I am glad you approve of what I have done,\" said he very comfortably.\\n\"But I thought you would.  Such schemes as these are nothing\\nwithout numbers.  One cannot have too large a party.  A large party\\nsecures its own amusement.  And she is a good-natured woman after all.\\nOne could not leave her out.\"\\n\\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\\n\\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\\nwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston\\nas to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw\\nevery thing into sad uncertainty.  It might be weeks, it might be\\nonly a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations\\ncould be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.\\nMrs. Elton\\'s resources were inadequate to such an attack.\\n\\n\"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?\" she cried.--\"And such weather\\nfor exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.\\nWhat are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,\\nand nothing done.  Before this time last year I assure you we had\\nhad a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\"\\n\\n\"You had better explore to Donwell,\" replied Mr. Knightley.\\n\"That may be done without horses.  Come, and eat my strawberries.\\nThey are ripening fast.\"\\n\\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \"Oh!  I should\\nlike it of all things,\" was not plainer in words than manner.\\nDonwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for\\nthe invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have\\nbeen enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.\\nShe promised him again and again to come--much oftener than\\nhe doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,\\nsuch a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.\\n\\n\"You may depend upon me,\" said she.  \"I certainly will come.\\nName your day, and I will come.  You will allow me to bring\\nJane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot name a day,\" said he, \"till I have spoken to some others\\nwhom I would wish to meet you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! leave all that to me.  Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am\\nLady Patroness, you know.  It is my party.  I will bring friends\\nwith me.\"\\n\\n\"I hope you will bring Elton,\" said he:  \"but I will not trouble\\nyou to give any other invitations.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! now you are looking very sly.  But consider--you need not be afraid\\nof delegating power to _me_.  I am no young lady on her preferment.\\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised.  It is my party.\\nLeave it all to me.  I will invite your guests.\"\\n\\n\"No,\"--he calmly replied,--\"there is but one married woman in the world\\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,\\nand that one is--\"\\n\\n\"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\\n\\n\"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage\\nsuch matters myself.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you are an odd creature!\" she cried, satisfied to have no\\none preferred to herself.--\"You are a humourist, and may say what\\nyou like.  Quite a humourist.  Well, I shall bring Jane with me--\\nJane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.  I have no objections\\nat all to meeting the Hartfield family.  Don\\'t scruple.  I know\\nyou are attached to them.\"\\n\\n\"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call\\non Miss Bates in my way home.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.\\nIt is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.\\nI shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets\\nhanging on my arm.  Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.\\nNothing can be more simple, you see.  And Jane will have such another.\\nThere is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are\\nto walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,\\nand sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,\\nit is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.\\nEvery thing as natural and simple as possible.  Is not that your idea?\"\\n\\n\"Not quite.  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\\nthe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity\\nof gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think\\nis best observed by meals within doors.  When you are tired of eating\\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Well--as you please; only don\\'t have a great set out.  And, by the bye,\\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--\\nPray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,\\nor to inspect anything--\"\\n\\n\"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper\\nis extremely clever.\"\\n\\n\"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,\\nand would spurn any body\\'s assistance.\"\\n\\n\"I wish we had a donkey.  The thing would be for us all to come\\non donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.\\nI really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.  In a country\\nlife I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have\\never so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut\\nup at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,\\nand in winter there is dirt.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.\\nDonwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.  Come on\\na donkey, however, if you prefer it.  You can borrow Mrs. Cole\\'s.\\nI would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.\"\\n\\n\"That I am sure you would.  Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\\nwarmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--\\nYes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention\\nto me in the whole of this scheme.  You have hit upon the very thing\\nto please me.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.\\nHe wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors\\nto eat would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not,\\nunder the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two\\nspent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\\n\\nHe was invited on good faith.  No lurking horrors were to upbraid\\nhim for his easy credulity.  He did consent.  He had not been\\nat Donwell for two years.  \"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,\\nand Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with\\nMrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.\\nHe did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of\\nthe day.  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,\\nand should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other\\nof his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,\\nand Emma\\'s, and Harriet\\'s going there some very fine morning.\\nHe thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--\\nvery kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not\\nfond of dining out.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\\'s most ready concurrence.\\nThe invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,\\nlike Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular\\ncompliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high\\nexpectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,\\npromised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof\\nof approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--\\nMr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad\\nto see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,\\nand spare no arguments to induce him to come.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party\\nto Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell\\nwas settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather\\nappearing exactly right.\\n\\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse\\nwas safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,\\nto partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most\\ncomfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a\\nfire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,\\nready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise\\nevery body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--\\nMrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,\\nand sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others\\nwere invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.\\n\\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\\nwas satisfied of her father\\'s comfort, she was glad to leave him,\\nand look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with\\nmore particular observation, more exact understanding of a house\\nand grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\\n\\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance\\nwith the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,\\nas she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,\\nits suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--\\nits ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,\\nof which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,\\nhad scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,\\nwhich neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house\\nwas larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good\\ndeal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,\\nand one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,\\nand it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,\\nuntainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John\\nKnightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.\\nShe had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could\\nraise a blush.  These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about\\nand indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,\\nand collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,\\nexcepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;\\nand Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet\\nand her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,\\naccepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,\\ncould now be thought or spoken of.--\"The best fruit in England--\\nevery body\\'s favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds\\nand finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one\\'s self--the only way\\nof really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--\\nevery sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--\\nthe others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--\\nwhite wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--\\nabundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to\\nbe renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--\\ngardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--\\nonly too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--\\ncurrants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries\\nthe stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--\\nmust go and sit in the shade.\"\\n\\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only\\nonce by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her\\nson-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--\\nShe had some fears of his horse.\\n\\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\\nto overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--\\nA situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.  Mrs. Elton\\nhad received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.\\nIt was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,\\nbut in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was\\nwith a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,\\na lady known at Maple Grove.  Delightful, charming, superior,\\nfirst circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton\\nwas wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,\\nall was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused\\nto take her friend\\'s negative, though Miss Fairfax continued\\nto assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,\\nrepeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--\\nStill Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence\\nby the morrow\\'s post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing\\nto Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,\\nwith a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--\\n\"Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--\\nall the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.\"--The pertinacity\\nof her friend seemed more than she could bear.\\n\\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short\\navenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal\\ndistance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--\\nIt led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone\\nwall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,\\nto give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had\\nbeen there.  Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such\\na termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view\\nwhich closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly\\nthe foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\\nform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank\\nof considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--\\nand at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,\\nrose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river\\nmaking a close and handsome curve around it.\\n\\nIt was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,\\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,\\nwithout being oppressive.\\n\\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;\\nand towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley\\nand Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was\\nglad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned\\nher as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.\\nNow they seemed in pleasant conversation.  There had been a time\\nalso when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot\\nso favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not.\\nIt might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity\\nand beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,\\nand light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,\\nand found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.\\nHe was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.\\nand Emma received a smile which seemed to say, \"These are my\\nown concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being\\nsuspected of introducing Robert Martin.\"--She did not suspect him.\\nIt was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think\\nof Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade\\nwas most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of\\nthe day.\\n\\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--\\nand they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did\\nnot come.  Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would\\nnot own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could\\nnot be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.\\nHe had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.\\n\"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting\\nover to them.\"--Mrs. Churchill\\'s state, however, as many were ready\\nto remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint\\nher nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston\\nwas at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be\\nby some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--\\nEmma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\\nshe behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\\n\\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more\\nto see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;\\nperhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting\\non the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,\\nand growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken\\nhis little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no\\ndamps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;\\nand his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston\\nmight be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety\\nwhich her spirits seemed to need.\\n\\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse\\'s\\nentertainment.  Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,\\ncorals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,\\nhad been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;\\nand the kindness had perfectly answered.  Mr. Woodhouse had been\\nexceedingly well amused.  Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him,\\nand now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other\\nresemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,\\nfor he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking\\nover was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake\\nof a few moments\\' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot\\nof the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,\\ncoming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--\\nLittle expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start\\nat first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.\\n\\n\"Will you be so kind,\" said she, \"when I am missed, as to say\\nthat I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware\\nhow late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we\\nshall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said\\nnothing about it to any body.  It would only be giving trouble\\nand distress.  Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.\\nTill they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,\\nwill you have the goodness to say that I am gone?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk\\nto Highbury alone?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.  I shall be at home\\nin twenty minutes.\"\\n\\n\"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.\\nLet my father\\'s servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.\\nIt can be round in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--\\nAnd for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have\\nto guard others!\"\\n\\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,\\n\"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.\\nI must order the carriage.  The heat even would be danger.--You are\\nfatigued already.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\"--she answered--\"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort\\nof fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all\\nknow at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.  Mine, I confess,\\nare exhausted.  The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let\\nme have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\"\\n\\nEmma had not another word to oppose.  She saw it all; and entering\\ninto her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,\\nand watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.  Her parting\\nlook was grateful--and her parting words, \"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,\\nthe comfort of being sometimes alone!\"--seemed to burst from\\nan overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual\\nendurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who\\nloved her best.\\n\\n\"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!\" said Emma, as she turned back\\ninto the hall again.  \"I do pity you.  And the more sensibility\\nyou betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you.\"\\n\\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\\naccomplished some views of St. Mark\\'s Place, Venice, when Frank\\nChurchill entered the room.  Emma had not been thinking of him,\\nshe had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him.\\nMrs. Weston would be at ease.  The black mare was blameless;\\n_they_ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.\\nHe had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;\\na nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given\\nup every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot\\na ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,\\nhe believed he should not have come at all.  The heat was excessive;\\nhe had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid\\nat home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,\\netc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest\\npossible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s fire,\\nlooking very deplorable.\\n\\n\"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\" said Emma.\\n\\n\"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.  I could very\\nill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!\\nYou will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.\\nI met _one_ as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!\"\\n\\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill\\'s\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being\\nout of humour.  Some people were always cross when they were hot.\\nSuch might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating\\nand drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,\\nshe recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance\\nof every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out\\nthe door.\\n\\n\"No--he should not eat.  He was not hungry; it would only make\\nhim hotter.\"  In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;\\nand muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.  Emma returned\\nall her attention to her father, saying in secret--\\n\\n\"I am glad I have done being in love with him.  I should not like a\\nman who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.  Harriet\\'s sweet\\neasy temper will not mind it.\"\\n\\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\\nback all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,\\nlike himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest\\nin their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he\\nshould be so late.  He was not in his best spirits, but seemed\\ntrying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense\\nvery agreeably.  They were looking over views in Swisserland.\\n\\n\"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\" said he.\\n\"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places.\\nYou will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour\\nto read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself.\"\\n\\n\"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.  You will\\nnever go to Swisserland.  Your uncle and aunt will never allow\\nyou to leave England.\"\\n\\n\"They may be induced to go too.  A warm climate may be prescribed\\nfor her.  I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad.\\nI assure you I have.  I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,\\nthat I shall soon be abroad.  I ought to travel.  I am tired\\nof doing nothing.  I want a change.  I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--\\nand would leave it to-morrow, if I could.\"\\n\\n\"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.  Cannot you invent\\na few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\"\\n\\n\"_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence!  You are quite mistaken.\\nI do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.  I am\\nthwarted in every thing material.  I do not consider myself at all\\na fortunate person.\"\\n\\n\"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.\\nGo and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.\\nAnother slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,\\nwill make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.\"\\n\\n\"No--I shall not stir.  I shall sit by you.  You are my best cure.\"\\n\\n\"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.\\nIt is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young\\nman so much in want of a change.  You will stay, and go with us?\"\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\"\\n\\n\"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"No--It will not be worth while.  If I come, I shall be cross.\"\\n\\n\"Then pray stay at Richmond.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.  I can never bear to think\\nof you all there without me.\"\\n\\n\"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.\\nChuse your own degree of crossness.  I shall press you no more.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;\\nothers took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress\\nand disturbance on Miss Fairfax\\'s disappearance being explained.\\nThat it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with\\na short final arrangement for the next day\\'s scheme, they parted.\\nFrank Churchill\\'s little inclination to exclude himself increased\\nso much, that his last words to Emma were,\\n\\n\"Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.\"\\n\\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from\\nRichmond was to take him back before the following evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,\\nwere in favour of a pleasant party.  Mr. Weston directed the whole,\\nofficiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every\\nbody was in good time.  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates\\nand her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.\\nMrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting\\nbut to be happy when they got there.  Seven miles were travelled\\nin expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration\\non first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there\\nwas deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,\\nwhich could not be got over.  They separated too much into parties.\\nThe Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss\\nBates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\\nAnd Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.  It seemed\\nat first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,\\nand be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours\\nthat were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,\\nbetween the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any\\ncold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\\n\\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma.  She had never seen Frank\\nChurchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--\\nlooked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without\\nknowing what she said.  While he was so dull, it was no wonder that\\nHarriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\\n\\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\\nEvery distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\\nTo amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\\ncared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\\nwas gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,\\nthe admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first\\nand most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,\\nin her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most\\npeople looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English\\nword but flirtation could very well describe.  \"Mr. Frank Churchill\\nand Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.\"  They were laying\\nthemselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off\\nin a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.\\nNot that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;\\nit was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected.\\nShe laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him\\nfor his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\\nadmiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning\\nback her heart.  She still intended him for her friend.\\n\\n\"How much I am obliged to you,\" said he, \"for telling me to come to-day!--\\nIf it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the\\nhappiness of this party.  I had quite determined to go away again.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,\\nexcept that you were too late for the best strawberries.\\nI was a kinder friend than you deserved.  But you were humble.\\nYou begged hard to be commanded to come.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say I was cross.  I was fatigued.  The heat overcame me.\"\\n\\n\"It is hotter to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Not to my feelings.  I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\"\\n\\n\"You are comfortable because you are under command.\"\\n\\n\"Your command?--Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your\\nown management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot\\nbe always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your\\nown command rather than mine.\"\\n\\n\"It comes to the same thing.  I can have no self-command without\\na motive.  You order me, whether you speak or not.  And you can\\nbe always with me.  You are always with me.\"\\n\\n\"Dating from three o\\'clock yesterday.  My perpetual influence\\ncould not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much\\nout of humour before.\"\\n\\n\"Three o\\'clock yesterday!  That is your date.  I thought I had seen\\nyou first in February.\"\\n\\n\"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.  But (lowering her voice)--\\nnobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be\\ntalking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.\"\\n\\n\"I say nothing of which I am ashamed,\" replied he, with lively impudence.\\n\"I saw you first in February.  Let every body on the Hill hear me if\\nthey can.  Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking\\non the other.  I saw you first in February.\"  And then whispering--\\n\"Our companions are excessively stupid.  What shall we do to rouse them?\\nAny nonsense will serve.  They _shall_ talk.  Ladies and gentlemen,\\nI am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)\\nto say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?\"\\n\\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;\\nMrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse\\'s presiding;\\nMr. Knightley\\'s answer was the most distinct.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are\\nall thinking of?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, no\"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--\\n\"Upon no account in the world.  It is the very last thing I\\nwould stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather\\nthan what you are all thinking of.  I will not say quite all.\\nThere are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)\\nwhose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.\"\\n\\n\"It is a sort of thing,\" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,\\n\"which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to\\ninquire into.  Though, perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--\\n_I_ never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--\"\\n\\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,\\nin reply,\\n\\n\"Very true, my love, very true.  Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard of--\\nbut some ladies say any thing.  Better pass it off as a joke.\\nEvery body knows what is due to _you_.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do,\" whispered Frank to Emma; \"they are most\\nof them affronted.  I will attack them with more address.\\nLadies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she\\nwaives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,\\nand only requires something very entertaining from each of you,\\nin a general way.  Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she\\nis pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only\\ndemands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose\\nor verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--\\nor three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily\\nat them all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very well,\" exclaimed Miss Bates, \"then I need not be uneasy.\\n`Three things very dull indeed.\\'  That will just do for me, you know.\\nI shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open\\nmy mouth, shan\\'t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured\\ndependence on every body\\'s assent)--Do not you all think I shall?\"\\n\\nEmma could not resist.\\n\\n\"Ah! ma\\'am, but there may be a difficulty.  Pardon me--but you\\nwill be limited as to number--only three at once.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could\\nnot anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\\n\\n\"Ah!--well--to be sure.  Yes, I see what she means, (turning to\\nMr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.  I must make\\nmyself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing\\nto an old friend.\"\\n\\n\"I like your plan,\" cried Mr. Weston.  \"Agreed, agreed.  I will do\\nmy best.  I am making a conundrum.  How will a conundrum reckon?\"\\n\\n\"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,\" answered his son;--\"but we shall\\nbe indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said Emma, \"it will not reckon low.  A conundrum of\\nMr. Weston\\'s shall clear him and his next neighbour.  Come, sir,\\npray let me hear it.\"\\n\\n\"I doubt its being very clever myself,\" said Mr. Weston.\\n\"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters\\nof the alphabet are there, that express perfection?\"\\n\\n\"What two letters!--express perfection!  I am sure I do not know.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you will never guess.  You, (to Emma), I am certain, will\\nnever guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?\"\\n\\nUnderstanding and gratification came together.  It might be a very\\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh\\nat and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem\\nto touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid\\nabout it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,\\n\\n\"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every\\nbody else.  _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\" said Mrs. Elton;\\n\"_I_ really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.\\nI had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not\\nat all pleased with.  I knew who it came from.  An abominable puppy!--\\nYou know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things\\nare very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;\\nbut quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring\\nabout the country in summer.  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.\\nI am not one of those who have witty things at every body\\'s service.\\nI do not pretend to be a wit.  I have a great deal of vivacity\\nin my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak\\nand when to hold my tongue.  Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.\\nPass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.  We have nothing clever to say--\\nnot one of us.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\" added her husband, with a sort of\\nsneering consciousness; \"_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain\\nMiss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.  An old married man--\\nquite good for nothing.  Shall we walk, Augusta?\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long\\non one spot.  Come, Jane, take my other arm.\"\\n\\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\\n\"Happy couple!\" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out\\nof hearing:--\"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as\\nthey did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only\\nknew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--\\nfor as to any real knowledge of a person\\'s disposition that Bath,\\nor any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be\\nno knowledge.  It is only by seeing women in their own homes,\\namong their own set, just as they always are, that you can form\\nany just judgment.  Short of that, it is all guess and luck--\\nand will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself\\non a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!\"\\n\\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her\\nown confederates, spoke now.\\n\\n\"Such things do occur, undoubtedly.\"--She was stopped by a cough.\\nFrank Churchill turned towards her to listen.\\n\\n\"You were speaking,\" said he, gravely.  She recovered her voice.\\n\\n\"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them\\nto be very frequent.  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--\\nbut there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.  I would\\nbe understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,\\n(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)\\nwho will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,\\nan oppression for ever.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\\n\\n\"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever\\nI marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.  Will you?\\n(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I\\nshould like any body fixed on by you.  You provide for the family,\\nyou know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.\\nI am in no hurry.  Adopt her, educate her.\"\\n\\n\"And make her like myself.\"\\n\\n\"By all means, if you can.\"\\n\\n\"Very well.  I undertake the commission.  You shall have a charming wife.\"\\n\\n\"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes.  I care for nothing else.\\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return,\\nI shall come to you for my wife.  Remember.\"\\n\\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting.  It was a commission to touch every\\nfavourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;\\nwho could say?  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\\n\\n\"Now, ma\\'am,\" said Jane to her aunt, \"shall we join Mrs. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"If you please, my dear.  With all my heart.  I am quite ready.\\nI was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.\\nWe shall soon overtake her.  There she is--no, that\\'s somebody else.\\nThat\\'s one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--\\nWell, I declare--\"\\n\\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley.\\nMr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young\\nman\\'s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew\\ntired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather\\nwalking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,\\nand quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful\\nviews beneath her.  The appearance of the servants looking out\\nfor them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;\\nand even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,\\nand the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_ carriage first,\\nwere gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was\\nto close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.\\nSuch another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.\\nHe looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\\n\\n\"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:\\na privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still\\nuse it.  I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.\\nHow could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?  How could you be so\\ninsolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--\\nEmma, I had not thought it possible.\"\\n\\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\\n\\n\"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\\nIt was not so very bad.  I dare say she did not understand me.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you she did.  She felt your full meaning.  She has talked\\nof it since.  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--\\nwith what candour and generosity.  I wish you could have heard her\\nhonouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,\\nas she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,\\nwhen her society must be so irksome.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Emma, \"I know there is not a better creature in the world:\\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are\\nmost unfortunately blended in her.\"\\n\\n\"They are blended,\" said he, \"I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous\\nover the good.  Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every\\nharmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you\\nfor any liberties of manner.  Were she your equal in situation--\\nbut, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.  She is poor;\\nshe has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live\\nto old age, must probably sink more.  Her situation should secure\\nyour compassion.  It was badly done, indeed!  You, whom she had known\\nfrom an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her\\nnotice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,\\nand the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before\\nher niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly _some_,)\\nwould be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her.--This is not\\npleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;\\nbut I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,\\nand trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice\\nthan you can do now.\"\\n\\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;\\nit was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.\\nHe had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,\\nand her tongue motionless.  They were combined only of anger\\nagainst herself, mortification, and deep concern.  She had not\\nbeen able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back\\nfor a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken\\nno leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,\\nshe looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;\\nbut it was just too late.  He had turned away, and the horses were\\nin motion.  She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,\\nwith what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,\\nand every thing left far behind.  She was vexed beyond what could\\nhave been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal.\\nNever had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance\\nin her life.  She was most forcibly struck.  The truth of this\\nrepresentation there was no denying.  She felt it at her heart.\\nHow could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!  How could\\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!\\nAnd how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,\\nof concurrence, of common kindness!\\n\\nTime did not compose her.  As she reflected more, she seemed\\nbut to feel it more.  She never had been so depressed.  Happily it\\nwas not necessary to speak.  There was only Harriet, who seemed not\\nin spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma\\nfelt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,\\nwithout being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma\\'s thoughts all\\nthe evening.  How it might be considered by the rest of the party,\\nshe could not tell.  They, in their different homes, and their different\\nways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it\\nwas a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,\\nthan any she had ever passed.  A whole evening of back-gammon with\\nher father, was felicity to it.  _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure,\\nfor there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four\\nto his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree\\nof his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her\\ngeneral conduct, be open to any severe reproach.  As a daughter,\\nshe hoped she was not without a heart.  She hoped no one could\\nhave said to her, \"How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--\\nI must, I will tell you truths while I can.\"  Miss Bates should\\nnever again--no, never!  If attention, in future, could do away\\nthe past, she might hope to be forgiven.  She had been often remiss,\\nher conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought\\nthan fact; scornful, ungracious.  But it should be so no more.\\nIn the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the\\nvery next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,\\nof a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\\n\\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,\\nthat nothing might prevent her.  It was not unlikely, she thought,\\nthat she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might\\ncome in while she were paying her visit.  She had no objection.\\nShe would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly\\nand truly hers.  Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she\\nsaw him not.\\n\\n\"The ladies were all at home.\"  She had never rejoiced at the sound\\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,\\nor of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\\n\\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\\nShe heard Miss Bates\\'s voice, something was to be done in a hurry;\\nthe maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased\\nto wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.  The aunt and\\nniece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.  Jane she had\\na distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door\\nhad shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, \"Well, my dear,\\nI shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are\\nill enough.\"\\n\\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she\\ndid not quite understand what was going on.\\n\\n\"I am afraid Jane is not very well,\" said she, \"but I do not know;\\nthey _tell_ me she is well.  I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\\nMiss Woodhouse.  I hope you find a chair.  I wish Hetty had not gone.\\nI am very little able--Have you a chair, ma\\'am? Do you sit where\\nyou like?  I am sure she will be here presently.\"\\n\\nEmma seriously hoped she would.  She had a moment\\'s fear of Miss\\nBates keeping away from her.  But Miss Bates soon came--\"Very happy\\nand obliged\"--but Emma\\'s conscience told her that there was not the\\nsame cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.\\nA very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead\\nthe way to a return of old feelings.  The touch seemed immediate.\\n\\n\"Ah!  Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--\\nand are come to give us joy.  This does not seem much like joy,\\nindeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be\\nvery trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,\\nand she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--\\nsuch long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,\\nand Mrs. Dixon.  `My dear,\\' said I, `you will blind yourself\\'--\\nfor tears were in her eyes perpetually.  One cannot wonder,\\none cannot wonder.  It is a great change; and though she is\\namazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman\\nbefore ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,\\nMiss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing\\nher tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache\\nshe has.  When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\\nany blessing quite as it may deserve.  She is as low as possible.\\nTo look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she\\nis to have secured such a situation.  You will excuse her not\\ncoming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--\\nI want her to lie down upon the bed.  `My dear,\\' said I, `I shall\\nsay you are laid down upon the bed:\\'  but, however, she is not;\\nshe is walking about the room.  But, now that she has written\\nher letters, she says she shall soon be well.  She will be extremely\\nsorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will\\nexcuse her.  You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--\\nbut somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we\\nhad not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did\\nnot know any body was coming.  `It is only Mrs. Cole,\\' said I,\\n`depend upon it.  Nobody else would come so early.\\'  `Well,\\' said she,\\n`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.\\'\\nBut then Patty came in, and said it was you.  `Oh!\\' said I,\\n`it is Miss Woodhouse:  I am sure you will like to see her.\\'--\\n`I can see nobody,\\' said she; and up she got, and would go away;\\nand that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry\\nand ashamed we were.  `If you must go, my dear,\\' said I, `you must,\\nand I will say you are laid down upon the bed.\\'\"\\n\\nEmma was most sincerely interested.  Her heart had been long growing\\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\\nbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\\nsensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\\nnaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,\\nwhen she might not bear to see herself.  She spoke as she felt,\\nwith earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the\\ncircumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually\\ndetermined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax\\'s advantage\\nand comfort as possible.  \"It must be a severe trial to them all.\\nShe had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell\\'s return.\"\\n\\n\"So very kind!\" replied Miss Bates.  \"But you are always kind.\"\\n\\nThere was no bearing such an \"always;\" and to break through her\\ndreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--\\n\\n\"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?\"\\n\\n\"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have\\nthe charge of her three little girls--delightful children.\\nImpossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;\\nif we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling\\'s own family, and Mrs. Bragge\\'s;\\nbut Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very\\nsame neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.\\nJane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton.  The most indefatigable, true friend.\\nShe would not take a denial.  She would not let Jane say, `No;\\' for\\nwhen Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,\\nthe very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,\\nshe was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the\\nreasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind\\nto close with nothing till Colonel Campbell\\'s return, and nothing\\nshould induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she\\ntold Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more\\nidea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,\\nwhose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.  It is not\\nevery body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,\\nand refuse to take Jane\\'s answer; but she positively declared she\\nwould _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;\\nshe would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all\\nsettled that Jane should go.  Quite a surprize to me!  I had not\\nthe least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,\\nthat upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge\\'s situation,\\nshe had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word\\nof it till it was all settled.\"\\n\\n\"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.  It was settled so,\\nupon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley.\\n`You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us,\\' said she--`I positively must\\nhave you _all_ come.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?\"\\n\\n\"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\\nhim off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\\nand a very agreeable evening we had.  Such kind friends, you know,\\nMiss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body\\nseemed rather fagged after the morning\\'s party.  Even pleasure,\\nyou know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed\\nvery much to have enjoyed it.  However, _I_ shall always think it\\na very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends\\nwho included me in it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\\nmaking up her mind the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she had.\"\\n\\n\"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all\\nher friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation\\nthat is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.  Yes, indeed, there is every thing\\nin the world that can make her happy in it.  Except the Sucklings\\nand Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,\\nso liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton\\'s acquaintance.\\nMrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost\\nequal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little\\nSucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet\\nchildren anywhere.  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--\\nIt will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--\\nI really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.\\nEven you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that\\nso much could be given to a young person like Jane.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! madam,\" cried Emma, \"if other children are at all like what I\\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount\\nof what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions,\\ndearly earned.\"\\n\\n\"You are so noble in your ideas!\"\\n\\n\"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?\"\\n\\n\"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that\\'s the worst of it.\\nWithin a fortnight.  Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.  My poor\\nmother does not know how to bear it.  So then, I try to put it out of\\nher thoughts, and say, Come ma\\'am, do not let us think about it any more.\"\\n\\n\"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel\\nand Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself\\nbefore their return?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such\\na situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.\\nI was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying\\nto Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating\\nme upon it!  It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,\\nbecause we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,\\nbecause I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;\\nsomething happened before tea, but not that.  Mr. Elton was called\\nout of the room before tea, old John Abdy\\'s son wanted to speak\\nwith him.  Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk\\nto my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is\\nbed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--\\nI must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she\\ngets out at all.  And poor John\\'s son came to talk to Mr. Elton\\nabout relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,\\nyou know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\\nof that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\\nand so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler\\nhad been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having\\nbeen sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.\\nThat was what happened before tea.  It was after tea that Jane spoke\\nto Mrs. Elton.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly\\nnew this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it\\npossible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars\\nof Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s going, she proceeded to give them all,\\nit was of no consequence.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\\naccumulation of the ostler\\'s own knowledge, and the knowledge\\nof the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over\\nfrom Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--\\nwhich messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;\\nand that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,\\nupon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only\\nwishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;\\nbut that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,\\nwithout waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,\\nTom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the\\nostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,\\nand driving very steady.\\n\\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,\\nand it caught Emma\\'s attention only as it united with the subject\\nwhich already engaged her mind.  The contrast between Mrs. Churchill\\'s\\nimportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax\\'s, struck her; one was\\nevery thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference\\nof woman\\'s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\\ntill roused by Miss Bates\\'s saying,\\n\\n\"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.  What is to become\\nof that?--Very true.  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--\\n`You must go,\\' said she.  `You and I must part.  You will have no\\nbusiness here.--Let it stay, however,\\' said she; `give it houseroom\\ntill Colonel Campbell comes back.  I shall talk about it to him;\\nhe will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.\\'--\\nAnd to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his\\npresent or his daughter\\'s.\"\\n\\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance\\nof all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been\\nlong enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could\\nventure to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma\\'s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her.\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were\\nsitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a\\nmanner decidedly graver than usual, said,\\n\\n\"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\\nand therefore must now be gone directly.  I am going to London,\\nto spend a few days with John and Isabella.  Have you any thing to\\nsend or say, besides the `love,\\' which nobody carries?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all.  But is not this a sudden scheme?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.\"\\n\\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.\\nTime, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be\\nfriends again.  While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--\\nher father began his inquiries.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you\\nfind my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must\\nhave been very much obliged to you for coming.  Dear Emma has been\\nto call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before.\\nShe is always so attentive to them!\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\\nand shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--\\nIt seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,\\nas if his eyes received the truth from her\\'s, and all that had\\npassed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard.  She was warmly gratified--\\nand in another moment still more so, by a little movement of\\nmore than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--\\nwhether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--\\nshe might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,\\npressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--\\nwhen, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel\\nsuch a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,\\nshe could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,\\nif he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;\\nand whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,\\nor however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--\\nIt was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--\\nShe could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.\\nIt spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--\\ngone in a moment.  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which\\ncould neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden\\nthan usual in his disappearance.\\n\\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished\\nshe had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great\\npleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax\\'s situation with Mr. Knightley.--\\nNeither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,\\nfor she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have\\nhappened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,\\nwould have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;\\nshe could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,\\nand his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she\\nhad fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them\\nhalf an hour, she found.  It was a pity that she had not come\\nback earlier!\\n\\nIn the hope of diverting her father\\'s thoughts from the disagreeableness\\nof Mr. Knightley\\'s going to London; and going so suddenly;\\nand going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\\nEmma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence\\non the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--\\ninterested, without disturbing him.  He had long made up his mind to Jane\\nFairfax\\'s going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,\\nbut Mr. Knightley\\'s going to London had been an unexpected blow.\\n\\n\"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so\\ncomfortably settled.  Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,\\nand I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought\\nto be.  I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health\\nwill be taken good care of.  It ought to be a first object,\\nas I am sure poor Miss Taylor\\'s always was with me.  You know,\\nmy dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\\nwas to us.  And I hope she will be better off in one respect,\\nand not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long.\"\\n\\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every\\nthing else into the background.  An express arrived at Randalls\\nto announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!  Though her nephew\\nhad had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,\\nshe had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return.\\nA sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded\\nby her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle.\\nThe great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\\n\\nIt was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a\\ndegree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,\\nsolicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,\\ncuriosity to know where she would be buried.  Goldsmith tells us,\\nthat when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do\\nbut to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally\\nto be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,\\nafter being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of\\nwith compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified.\\nShe had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event\\nacquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness\\nof imaginary complaints.\\n\\n\"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\\nmore than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try\\nthe temper.  It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,\\nwhat would Mr. Churchill do without her?  Mr. Churchill\\'s loss\\nwould be dreadful indeed.  Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\"--\\nEven Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,\\n\"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!\" and resolved, that his\\nmourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing\\nand moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,\\ntrue and steady.  How it would affect Frank was among the earliest\\nthoughts of both.  It was also a very early speculation with Emma.\\nThe character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind\\nglanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested\\nwith lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,\\nhow benefited, how freed.  She saw in a moment all the possible good.\\nNow, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter.\\nMr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;\\nan easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.\\nAll that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\\nthe attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\\nno certainty of its being already formed.\\n\\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\\nWhat ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.  Emma was\\ngratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\\nThey spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill\\'s death with mutual forbearance.\\n\\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating\\nall that was immediately important of their state and plans.\\nMr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their\\nfirst removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,\\nwas to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom\\nMr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.\\nAt present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes\\nfor the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma\\'s side.\\n\\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,\\nwhose prospects were closing, while Harriet\\'s opened, and whose\\nengagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished\\nto shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.\\nShe had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;\\nand the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now\\nthe very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of\\nregard or sympathy.  She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew\\na value for her society, and testify respect and consideration.\\nShe resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield.\\nA note was written to urge it.  The invitation was refused, and by\\na verbal message.  \"Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;\"\\nand when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,\\nit appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\\nthough against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\\nunder severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made\\nhim doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge\\'s at the\\ntime proposed.  Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--\\nappetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely\\nalarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,\\nwhich was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was\\nuneasy about her.  He thought she had undertaken more than she\\nwas equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would\\nnot own it.  Her spirits seemed overcome.  Her present home,\\nhe could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--\\nconfined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--\\nand her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge\\nto be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.\\nHer care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,\\nonly too great.  He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more\\nevil than good from them.  Emma listened with the warmest concern;\\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover\\nsome way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour\\nor two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,\\nand quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,\\nmight do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,\\nin the most feeling language she could command, that she would\\ncall for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--\\nmentioning that she had Mr. Perry\\'s decided opinion, in favour\\nof such exercise for his patient.  The answer was only in this\\nshort note:\\n\\n\"Miss Fairfax\\'s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal\\nto any exercise.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it\\nwas impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality\\nshewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she\\nmight best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.\\nIn spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove\\nto Mrs. Bates\\'s, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--\\nbut it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,\\nand agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of\\nthe greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--\\nbut all in vain.  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;\\nJane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out\\nseemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,\\nand tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,\\nMiss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on\\nno account to let Miss Woodhouse in.  \"Indeed, the truth was,\\nthat poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--\\nMrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made\\nsuch a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,\\nJane would really see nobody.\"\\n\\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;\\nneither could she feel any right of preference herself--\\nshe submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther\\nas to her niece\\'s appetite and diet, which she longed to be able\\nto assist.  On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,\\nand very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--\\nMr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could\\ncommand (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.\\n\\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.\\nIn half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks\\nfrom Miss Bates, but \"dear Jane would not be satisfied without its\\nbeing sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,\\nshe insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\"\\n\\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon\\nof the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal\\nto any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in\\nthe carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--\\nthat Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_.  She was sorry,\\nvery sorry.  Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed\\nbut the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,\\ninconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified\\nher that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed\\nso little worthy as a friend:  but she had the consolation of knowing\\nthat her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,\\nthat could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts\\nof assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,\\nhe would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill\\'s decease,\\nEmma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \"could not stay\\nfive minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.\"--\\nHe met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,\\nin the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,\\nunheard by her father,\\n\\n\"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it\\nbe possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you.\"\\n\\n\"Is she unwell?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have\\nordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_,\\nand that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to\\nrefuse what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?--\\nIs she really not ill?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it\\nall in time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!\"\\n\\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.\\nSomething really important seemed announced by his looks;\\nbut, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,\\nand settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,\\nshe and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on\\ntheir way at a quick pace for Randalls.\\n\\n\"Now,\"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\\n\"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don\\'t ask me.  I promised my wife\\nto leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can.\\nDo not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\"\\n\\n\"Break it to me,\" cried Emma, standing still with terror.--\\n\"Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened\\nin Brunswick Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell\\nme this moment what it is.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed you are mistaken.\"--\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?--\\nI charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Emma.\"--\\n\\n\"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,\\nthat it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!--What can\\nbe to be _broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour,\" said he very seriously, \"it does not.  It is not\\nin the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name\\nof Knightley.\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s courage returned, and she walked on.\\n\\n\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\\nI should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you--\\nit concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,\\nmy dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.\\nI don\\'t say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might\\nbe much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\"\\n\\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.\\nShe asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,\\nand that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some\\nmoney concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable\\nnature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late\\nevent at Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active.\\nHalf a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--\\nThis, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.\\nIt inspired little more than an animating curiosity.\\n\\n\"Who is that gentleman on horseback?\" said she, as they proceeded--\\nspeaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with\\nany other view.\\n\\n\"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,\\nI assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor\\nby this time.\"\\n\\n\"Has your son been with you, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\"\\n\\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more\\nguarded and demure,\\n\\n\"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\"\\n\\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well, my dear,\"\\nsaid he, as they entered the room--\"I have brought her, and now\\nI hope you will soon be better.  I shall leave you together.\\nThere is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.\"--\\nAnd Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he\\nquitted the room,--\"I have been as good as my word.  She has not the\\nleast idea.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\\nthat Emma\\'s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,\\nshe eagerly said,\\n\\n\"What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature,\\nI find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.\\nI have been walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both\\nabhor suspense.  Do not let mine continue longer.  It will do you\\ngood to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.\"\\n\\n\"Have you indeed no idea?\" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\\n\"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you\\nare to hear?\"\\n\\n\"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\"\\n\\n\"You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\"\\n(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)\\n\"He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.\\nIt is impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his\\nfather on a subject,--to announce an attachment--\"\\n\\nShe stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then\\nof Harriet.\\n\\n\"More than an attachment, indeed,\" resumed Mrs. Weston; \"an engagement--\\na positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any\\nbody say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax\\nare engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\"\\n\\nEmma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?\"\\n\\n\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\\nand talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\\n\"You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn\\nengagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,\\nand kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it\\nbut themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--\\nIt is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,\\nit is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.--\\nI thought I knew him.\"\\n\\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between\\ntwo ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;\\nand poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,\\nand require confirmation, repeated confirmation.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said she at last, trying to recover herself; \"this is a\\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I\\ncan at all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--\\nbefore either of them came to Highbury?\"\\n\\n\"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,\\nEmma, very much.  It has hurt his father equally.  _Some_ _part_\\nof his conduct we cannot excuse.\"\\n\\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, \"I will not pretend\\n_not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,\\nbe assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,\\nas you are apprehensive of.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma\\'s countenance\\nwas as steady as her words.\\n\\n\"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\\npresent perfect indifference,\" she continued, \"I will farther tell you,\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,\\nwhen I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be\\nattached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,\\nis perhaps the wonder.  Fortunately, however, it did cease.\\nI have really for some time past, for at least these three months,\\ncared nothing about him.  You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.\\nThis is the simple truth.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could\\nfind utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done\\nher more good than any thing else in the world could do.\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\" said she.\\n\"On this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you\\nmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.\"\\n\\n\"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of\\ngrateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit _him_,\\nMrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.\\nWhat right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,\\nand with manners so _very_ disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour\\nto please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with\\npersevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged\\nto another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--\\nHow could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--\\nvery wrong, very wrong indeed.\"\\n\\n\"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\"\\n\\n\"And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!\\nto look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\\nbefore her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.\"\\n\\n\"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said\\nso expressly.  He had not time to enter into much explanation.\\nHe was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation\\nwhich did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--\\nbut that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.\\nThe present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;\\nand those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the\\nimpropriety of his conduct.\"\\n\\n\"Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.\\nMuch, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how\\nit has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!--\\nNone of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth\\nand principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man\\nshould display in every transaction of his life.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been\\nwrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer\\nfor his having many, very many, good qualities; and--\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too!\\nJane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he\\nmean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--\\nto suffer her even to think of such a measure!\"\\n\\n\"He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully\\nacquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated\\nto him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--\\nTill yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.\\nThey burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--\\nand it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project\\nof hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it\\nall to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,\\nput an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been\\ncarrying on so long.\"\\n\\nEmma began to listen better.\\n\\n\"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston.  \"He told me\\nat parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.\\nLet us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations.\\nIt may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are\\nnot to be understood.  Don\\'t let us be severe, don\\'t let us be in\\na hurry to condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him;\\nand now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,\\nI am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready\\nto hope that it may.  They must both have suffered a great deal\\nunder such a system of secresy and concealment.\"\\n\\n\"_His_ sufferings,\" replied Emma dryly, \"do not appear to have done\\nhim much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\"\\n\\n\"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely\\na difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done\\nin that family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there\\ncould not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely\\nare her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is\\npersuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required.\\nWhat a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--\\nHe gave his consent with very little persuasion.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" thought Emma, \"he would have done as much for Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light\\nthis morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates\\'s, I fancy,\\nsome time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get\\nback to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,\\nthat, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--\\nHe was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made\\nhim appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen\\nhim before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of\\nfinding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--\\nand there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on\\nwith such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none\\nof them know of the engagement?\"\\n\\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\\n\\n\"None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no\\nbeing in the world but their two selves.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled\\nto the idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always\\nthink it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been\\nbut a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--\\nTo come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;\\nand such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,\\nthe whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves\\nall on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the\\nmidst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting\\nin judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both\\nto hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each\\nother spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!\"\\n\\n\"I am quite easy on that head,\" replied Mrs. Weston.  \"I am\\nvery sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,\\nwhich both might not have heard.\"\\n\\n\"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,\\nwhen you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\"\\n\\n\"True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;\\nand as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\\nevidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited\\nhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, \"Now, dearest Emma,\\nlet me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his\\nheart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.\\nLet us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may\\nbe fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;\\nbut if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it\\nmay be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,\\nthat he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness\\nof character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--\\nand still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this\\none great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much\\nmay be said in her situation for even that error!\"\\n\\n\"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly.  \"If a woman can ever\\nbe excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation\\nlike Jane Fairfax\\'s.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the\\nworld is not their\\'s, nor the world\\'s law.\\'\"\\n\\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\\nexclaiming,\\n\\n\"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!\\nThis was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,\\nand exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me.\\nI thought you had lost half your property, at least.  And here,\\ninstead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one\\nof congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,\\non the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished\\nyoung women in England for your daughter.\"\\n\\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was\\nas right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\\nwas immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness:\\nhe shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered\\non the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted\\ntime and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.\\nHis companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,\\nor smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all\\nover together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,\\nin their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,\\nand not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could\\npossibly have done.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\n\"Harriet, poor Harriet!\"--Those were the words; in them lay the\\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\\nthe real misery of the business to her.  Frank Churchill had behaved\\nvery ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much\\n_his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him.\\nIt was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet\\'s account,\\nthat gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second\\ntime the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley\\nhad spoken prophetically, when he once said, \"Emma, you have been\\nno friend to Harriet Smith.\"--She was afraid she had done her nothing\\nbut disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,\\nin this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original\\nauthor of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might\\notherwise never have entered Harriet\\'s imagination; for Harriet\\nhad acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill\\nbefore she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt\\ncompletely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.\\nShe might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.\\nHer influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious\\nthat she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been\\nrisking her friend\\'s happiness on most insufficient grounds.\\nCommon sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she\\nmust not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five\\nhundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--\"But, with\\ncommon sense,\" she added, \"I am afraid I have had little to do.\"\\n\\nShe was extremely angry with herself.  If she could not have been\\nangry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--\\nAs for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings\\nfrom any present solicitude on her account.  Harriet would\\nbe anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,\\nwhose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,\\nmust be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil\\nwere over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--\\nEmma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.\\nThis discovery laid many smaller matters open.  No doubt it had been\\nfrom jealousy.--In Jane\\'s eyes she had been a rival; and well might\\nany thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.\\nAn airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.\\nShe understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself\\nfrom the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged\\nthat Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond\\nher desert.  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!\\nThere was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.\\nEmma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be\\nmore severe than the first.  Considering the very superior claims\\nof the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect\\non Harriet\\'s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--\\nShe must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon\\nas possible.  An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston\\'s\\nparting words.  \"For the present, the whole affair was to be\\ncompletely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,\\nas a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\"--\\nEmma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her\\nsuperior duty.\\n\\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,\\nthat she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to\\nperform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.\\nThe intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another.  Her heart beat\\nquick on hearing Harriet\\'s footstep and voice; so, she supposed,\\nhad poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.\\nCould the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--\\nBut of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\\n\"is not this the oddest news that ever was?\"\\n\\n\"What news do you mean?\" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look\\nor voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\\n\\n\"About Jane Fairfax.  Did you ever hear any thing so strange?\\nOh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has\\ntold me himself.  I met him just now.  He told me it was to be\\na great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning\\nit to any body but you, but he said you knew it.\"\\n\\n\"What did Mr. Weston tell you?\"--said Emma, still perplexed.\\n\\n\"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank\\nChurchill are to be married, and that they have been privately\\nengaged to one another this long while.  How very odd!\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet\\'s behaviour was so extremely odd,\\nthat Emma did not know how to understand it.  Her character appeared\\nabsolutely changed.  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,\\nor disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.  Emma looked\\nat her, quite unable to speak.\\n\\n\"Had you any idea,\" cried Harriet, \"of his being in love\\nwith her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)\\nwho can see into every body\\'s heart; but nobody else--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Emma, \"I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\\nto another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--\\nencouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had\\nthe slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill\\'s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.  You may be\\nvery sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  \"Why should you\\ncaution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\"\\n\\n\"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\"\\nreplied Emma, smiling; \"but you do not mean to deny that there\\nwas a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason\\nto understand that you did care about him?\"\\n\\n\"Him!--never, never.  Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\"\\nturning away distressed.\\n\\n\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, after a moment\\'s pause--\"What do you mean?--\\nGood Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\"\\n\\nShe could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she\\nsat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\\n\\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned\\nfrom her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,\\nit was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma\\'s.\\n\\n\"I should not have thought it possible,\" she began, \"that you\\ncould have misunderstood me!  I know we agreed never to name him--\\nbut considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,\\nI should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed\\nto mean any other person.  Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!  I do not\\nknow who would ever look at him in the company of the other.\\nI hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,\\nwho is like nobody by his side.  And that you should have been\\nso mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you\\nentirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,\\nI should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\\nto dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not told me\\nthat more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\\nmatches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--\\nI should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought\\nit possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--\"\\n\\n\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us\\nunderstand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.\\nAre you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I am.  I never could have an idea of any body else--\\nand so I thought you knew.  When we talked about him, it was as clear\\nas possible.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite,\" returned Emma, with forced calmness, \"for all that\\nyou then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.\\nI could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.\\nI am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,\\nin protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I\\nsaid on the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at\\nyour attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,\\nit was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself\\nvery warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning\\neven what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward\\nto your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear,\" cried Harriet, \"now I recollect what you mean; but I\\nwas thinking of something very different at the time.  It was not\\nthe gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with\\nsome elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--\\nof Mr. Knightley\\'s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton\\nwould not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in\\nthe room.  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence\\nand generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel\\nhow superior he was to every other being upon earth.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--\\nmost deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\"\\n\\n\"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?\\nAt least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,\\nif the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\"\\n\\nShe paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.\\n\\n\"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\" she resumed, \"that you should feel\\na great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.\\nYou must think one five hundred million times more above me than\\nthe other.  But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--\\nstrange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,\\nthat _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity\\nhad taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,\\nit seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--\\nand if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--\\nif Mr. Knightley should really--if _he_ does not mind the disparity,\\nI hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,\\nand try to put difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round\\nto look at her in consternation, and hastily said,\\n\\n\"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley\\'s returning your affection?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\"I must say\\nthat I have.\"\\n\\nEmma\\'s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,\\nonce opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--\\nshe admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it\\nso much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,\\nthan with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased\\nby Harriet\\'s having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,\\nwith the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one\\nbut herself!\\n\\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the\\nsame few minutes.  She saw it all with a clearness which had\\nnever blessed her before.  How improperly had she been acting\\nby Harriet!  How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,\\nhow unfeeling had been her conduct!  What blindness, what madness,\\nhad led her on!  It struck her with dreadful force, and she\\nwas ready to give it every bad name in the world.  Some portion\\nof respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--\\nsome concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice\\nby Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl\\nwho believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)\\ngave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,\\nwith even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit\\nthat the utmost extent of Harriet\\'s hopes should be enquired into;\\nand Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest\\nwhich had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve\\nto be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--\\nRousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,\\nshe turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed\\nthe conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,\\nthe wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--\\nNeither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.\\n\\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\\nand such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,\\nto give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\\ndelight.--Emma\\'s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,\\nwere better concealed than Harriet\\'s, but they were not less.\\nHer voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation\\nthat such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,\\nsuch a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--\\nShe listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward\\npatience, to Harriet\\'s detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,\\nor very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;\\nbut it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and\\ntautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--\\nespecially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory\\nbrought in favour of Mr. Knightley\\'s most improved opinion of Harriet.\\n\\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\\nfound her much superior to his expectation.  From that evening,\\nor at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse\\'s encouraging her\\nto think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking\\nto her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having\\nindeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness\\nand sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.\\nWhen they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked\\nby her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be\\nacquainted with her.  Emma knew it to have been very much the case.\\nShe had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--\\nHarriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--\\nand Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\\nknown of his opinion of Harriet.  He praised her for being without\\nart or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--\\nShe knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt\\non them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet\\'s memory,\\nmany little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,\\na speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,\\na preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\\nby Emma.  Circumstances that might swell to half an hour\\'s relation,\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences\\nto be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not\\nwithout some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,\\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk\\nat Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,\\nand he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from\\nthe rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more\\nparticular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular\\nway indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed\\nto be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--\\nBut as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,\\nhe changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--\\nThe second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\\nbefore Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his\\nbeing at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said\\nthat he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,\\nduring their conversation, that though he must go to London,\\nit was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,\\nwhich was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.\\nThe superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one\\narticle marked, gave her severe pain.\\n\\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,\\nafter a little reflection, venture the following question.\\n\"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,\\ninto the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--\\nhe might have Mr. Martin\\'s interest in view?  But Harriet rejected\\nthe suspicion with spirit.\\n\\n\"Mr. Martin!  No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.\\nI hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be\\nsuspected of it.\"\\n\\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear\\nMiss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\\n\\n\"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she,\\n\"but for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let\\nhis behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem\\nto feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,\\nit will not be any thing so very wonderful.\"\\n\\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\\nfeelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma\\'s side,\\nto enable her to say on reply,\\n\\n\"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is\\nthe last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman\\nthe idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.\"\\n\\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;\\nand Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at\\nthat moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\\nfather\\'s footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was\\ntoo much agitated to encounter him.  \"She could not compose herself--\\nMr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\"--with most ready\\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\\nanother door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous\\nburst of Emma\\'s feelings:  \"Oh God! that I had never seen her!\"\\n\\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough\\nfor her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion\\nof all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.\\nEvery moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize\\nmust be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!\\nHow to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising\\non herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her\\nown head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her\\nown room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,\\nshe perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed\\non by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing\\non herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,\\nand should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.\\n\\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the\\nfirst endeavour.  To that point went every leisure moment which her\\nfather\\'s claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary\\nabsence of mind.\\n\\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\\ndeclared him now to be?  When had his influence, such influence begun?--\\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\\nshe compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in\\nher estimation, from the time of the latter\\'s becoming known to her--\\nand as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--\\noh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute\\nthe comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she\\ndid not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when\\nhis regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.  She saw,\\nthat in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,\\nshe had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her\\nown heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank\\nChurchill at all!\\n\\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.\\nThis was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,\\nwhich she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--\\nShe was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation\\nbut the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--\\nEvery other part of her mind was disgusting.\\n\\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\\nbody\\'s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\\nbody\\'s destiny.  She was proved to have been universally mistaken;\\nand she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief.\\nShe had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared,\\non Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to\\ntake place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it\\na beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only\\nby a consciousness of Harriet\\'s;--and even were this not the case,\\nhe would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.\\n\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every\\nwonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane\\nFairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison,\\nexciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing\\nto be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an\\nelevation on her side!  Such a debasement on his!  It was horrible\\nto Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion,\\nto foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at\\nhis expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand\\ninconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.\\nAnd yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new\\ncircumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by\\nvery inferior powers?  Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek,\\nto be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any\\nthing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for\\nchance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?\\n\\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward!  Had she left her where\\nshe ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,\\nwith a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying\\nthe unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy\\nand respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong--\\nall would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\\n\\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise\\nher thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy\\nherself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--\\nBut Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--\\nHer inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--\\nShe had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton\\'s being to stoop\\nin marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley\\'s.--\\nAlas! was not that her own doing too?  Who had been at pains to give\\nHarriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself\\nhad taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--\\nIf Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\\nfirst in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,\\nand feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;\\nand only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly\\nimportant it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;\\nfor, having no female connexions of his own, there had been\\nonly Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she\\nhad always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.\\nShe had herself been first with him for many years past.\\nShe had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse,\\nslighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of\\nhalf his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not\\nacknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\\nfrom family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind,\\nhe had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour\\nto improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\\nother creature had at all shared.  In spite of all her faults,\\nshe knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?--\\nWhen the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,\\npresented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them.\\nHarriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,\\nexclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.  _She_ could not.\\nShe could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment\\nto _her_.  She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--\\nHow shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!  How directly,\\nhow strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too\\nstrongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from\\nany feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.--\\nShe had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could\\nhave that sort of affection for herself which was now in question;\\nbut there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,)\\nthat Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his\\nregard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence\\nnothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.\\nCould she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,\\nshe believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue\\nthe same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley\\nto all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their\\nprecious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\\nwould be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.\\nIt would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with\\nwhat she felt for him.  Nothing should separate her from her father.\\nShe would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;\\nand she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at\\nleast be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should\\nsee them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly\\nas she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching,\\nshe did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.--\\nHe was expected back every day.  The power of observation would be\\nsoon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in\\none course.  In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.--\\nIt would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good,\\nto be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced,\\nas long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing\\nHarriet\\'s confidence.  To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote\\nto her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not,\\nat present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction,\\nthat all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better\\nbe avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before\\nthey met again, except in the company of others--she objected only\\nto a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten\\nthe conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved,\\nand was grateful.\\n\\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma\\'s\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself,\\nto relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\\n\\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates\\'s, and gone through his\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having\\nthen induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned\\nwith much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,\\nthan a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates\\'s parlour, with all\\nthe encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.\\n\\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while\\nher friend related.  Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit\\nin a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had\\nwished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write\\nto Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till\\na little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled\\nto the engagement\\'s becoming known; as, considering every thing,\\nshe thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--\\nbut Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious\\nto shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not\\nconceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,\\nthat it would be of any consequence; for \"such things,\" he observed,\\n\"always got about.\"  Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had\\nvery good reason for saying so.  They had gone, in short--and very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.\\nShe had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action\\nhad shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.  The quiet,\\nheart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight\\nof her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,\\nhad been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.  They were\\nboth so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested\\nin every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,\\nand so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work\\nfor them.  Miss Fairfax\\'s recent illness had offered a fair plea\\nfor Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and\\ndeclined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the\\ncourse of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,\\novercome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse\\non the important subject.  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious\\nsilence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the\\ngratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,\\nmust necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,\\nthey had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state\\nof the engagement.  Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation\\nmust be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own\\nmind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased\\nwith all that she had said on the subject.\\n\\n\"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment\\nof so many months,\" continued Mrs. Weston, \"she was energetic.\\nThis was one of her expressions.  `I will not say, that since I\\nentered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I\\ncan say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:\\'--\\nand the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation\\nthat I felt at my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Poor girl!\" said Emma.  \"She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\\nconsented to a private engagement?\"\\n\\n\"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\\nto blame herself.  `The consequence,\\' said she, `has been a state\\nof perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.  But after all the\\npunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\\nPain is no expiation.  I never can be blameless.  I have been acting\\ncontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\\nthing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\\nconscience tells me ought not to be.\\'  `Do not imagine, madam,\\'\\nshe continued, `that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection\\nfall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought\\nme up.  The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,\\nwith all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,\\nI shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Poor girl!\" said Emma again.  \"She loves him then excessively,\\nI suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could\\nbe led to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered\\nher judgment.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" returned Emma, sighing, \"that I must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding\\nto the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.\\nOne natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\"\\nshe said, \"was that of making her _unreasonable_.  The consciousness\\nof having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,\\nand made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--\\nthat had been--hard for him to bear.  `I did not make the allowances,\\'\\nsaid she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--\\nhis delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness\\nof disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,\\nhave been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.\\'\\nShe then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you\\nhad shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me\\nhow it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,\\nto thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and\\nevery endeavour to do her good.  She was sensible that you had never\\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself.\"\\n\\n\"If I did not know her to be happy now,\" said Emma, seriously,\\n\"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous\\nconscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!\\nMrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil\\nand the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,\\nand trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.\\nYou are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.\\nThey shew her to the greatest advantage.  I am sure she is very good--\\nI hope she will be very happy.  It is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\"\\n\\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.\\nShe thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,\\nshe loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.\\nShe talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--\\nbut she had too much to urge for Emma\\'s attention; it was soon gone\\nto Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;\\nand when Mrs. Weston ended with, \"We have not yet had the letter\\nwe are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,\"\\nshe was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged\\nto answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it\\nwas which they were so anxious for.\\n\\n\"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston\\'s parting question.\\n\\n\"Oh! perfectly.  I am always well, you know.  Be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston\\'s communications furnished Emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,\\nand her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.  She bitterly\\nregretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed\\nfor the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,\\nthe cause.  Had she followed Mr. Knightley\\'s known wishes, in paying\\nthat attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she\\ntried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;\\nhad she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;\\nshe must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain\\nwhich pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,\\nhad been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received\\nwith gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that\\nthey had never become intimate friends; that she had never been\\nadmitted into Miss Fairfax\\'s confidence on this important matter--\\nwhich was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,\\nand as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable\\nsuspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\\nnot only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made\\na subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane\\'s feelings,\\nby the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill\\'s.  Of all the sources\\nof evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,\\nshe was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.\\nShe must have been a perpetual enemy.  They never could have been\\nall three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax\\'s peace\\nin a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been\\nthe agony of a mind that would bear no more.\\n\\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\\nThe weather added what it could of gloom.  A cold stormy rain set in,\\nand nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the\\nwind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made\\nsuch cruel sights the longer visible.\\n\\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter\\'s side,\\nand by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.\\nIt reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening\\nof Mrs. Weston\\'s wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked\\nin then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.\\nAlas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield\\'s attraction, as those\\nsort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.  The picture which\\nshe had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,\\nhad proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures\\nhad been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would\\nexperience no similar contradiction.  The prospect before her now,\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--\\nthat might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place\\nthat might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must\\nbe comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\\n\\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer\\nthan herself; and Mrs. Weston\\'s heart and time would be occupied\\nby it.  They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,\\nher husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;\\nand Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease\\nto belong to Highbury.  They would be married, and settled either\\nat or near Enscombe.  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if\\nto these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would\\nremain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?\\nMr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--\\nNo longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change\\nhis own home for their\\'s!--How was it to be endured?  And if he were\\nto be lost to them for Harriet\\'s sake; if he were to be thought\\nof hereafter, as finding in Harriet\\'s society all that he wanted;\\nif Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,\\nthe wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;\\nwhat could be increasing Emma\\'s wretchedness but the reflection never far\\ndistant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?\\n\\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain\\nfrom a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room\\nfor a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\\nor composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own\\nbetter conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and\\ngaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life\\nto the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted\\nwith herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning;\\nand the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to\\nreign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind\\nchanged into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;\\nthe sun appeared; it was summer again.  With all the eagerness\\nwhich such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors\\nas soon as possible.  Never had the exquisite sight, smell,\\nsensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,\\nbeen more attractive to her.  She longed for the serenity they might\\ngradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry\\'s coming in soon after dinner,\\nwith a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill\\nhurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,\\nand thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she\\nsaw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\\ntowards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned\\nfrom London.  She had been thinking of him the moment before,\\nas unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for\\nthe quickest arrangement of mind.  She must be collected and calm.\\nIn half a minute they were together.  The \"How d\\'ye do\\'s\" were quiet\\nand constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends;\\nthey were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.\\nHe must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,\\nshe found.  \"He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he\\nwas not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\"--She thought\\nhe neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible\\ncause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been\\ncommunicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner\\nin which they had been received.\\n\\nThey walked together.  He was silent.  She thought he was often\\nlooking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it\\nsuited her to give.  And this belief produced another dread.\\nPerhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;\\nhe might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,\\ncould not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.\\nHe must do it all himself.  Yet she could not bear this silence.\\nWith him it was most unnatural.  She considered--resolved--and, trying\\nto smile, began--\\n\\n\"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\\nsurprize you.\"\\n\\n\"Have I?\" said he quietly, and looking at her; \"of what nature?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\"\\n\\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\\nhe replied,\\n\\n\"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard\\nthat already.\"\\n\\n\"How is it possible?\" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks\\ntowards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he\\nmight have called at Mrs. Goddard\\'s in his way.\\n\\n\"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,\\nand at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\"\\n\\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little\\nmore composure,\\n\\n\"_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\\nhad your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\\nme a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking\\nvoice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\"\\n\\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious\\nof having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm\\ndrawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him\\nthus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\\n\\n\"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own\\nexcellent sense--your exertions for your father\\'s sake--I know\\nyou will not allow yourself--.\"  Her arm was pressed again,\\nas he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, \"The feelings\\nof the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\"--\\nAnd in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, \"He will soon\\nbe gone.  They will soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for _her_.\\nShe deserves a better fate.\"\\n\\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the\\nflutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\\n\\n\"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\\nI am not in want of that sort of compassion.  My blindness to what\\nwas going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always\\nbe ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many\\nthings which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I\\nhave no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\"\\n\\n\"Emma!\" cried he, looking eagerly at her, \"are you, indeed?\"--\\nbut checking himself--\"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am\\npleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,\\nindeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes\\nthe acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your\\naffections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,\\nfrom your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--\\nI could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference\\nwhich I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name\\nof man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--\\nJane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\\n\"I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in\\nyour error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,\\nI have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have\\nbeen at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might\\nbe natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--\\nBut I never have.\"\\n\\nHe listened in perfect silence.  She wished him to speak, but he\\nwould not.  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled\\nto his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower\\nherself in his opinion.  She went on, however.\\n\\n\"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted\\nby his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--\\nAn old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened\\nto hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable\\nin one who sets up as I do for Understanding.  Many circumstances\\nassisted the temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was\\ncontinually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,\\nfor (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,\\nthey all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I\\nallowed his attentions.  Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--\\nI have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them\\na habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.  I have never been\\nattached to him.  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.\\nHe never wished to attach me.  It was merely a blind to conceal\\nhis real situation with another.--It was his object to blind\\nall about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually\\nblinded than myself--except that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my\\ngood fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him.\"\\n\\nShe had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far\\nas she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably\\nin his usual tone, he said,\\n\\n\"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\\nhowever, that I may have underrated him.  My acquaintance with\\nhim has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated\\nhim hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has\\na chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,\\nwhose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,\\nI shall certainly wish him well.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of their being happy together,\" said Emma;\\n\"I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\"\\n\\n\"He is a most fortunate man!\" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.\\n\"So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man\\nchuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.  At three-and-twenty\\nto have drawn such a prize!  What years of felicity that man,\\nin all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of\\nsuch a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax\\'s character\\nvouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--\\nequality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the\\nhabits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--\\nand that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,\\nsuch as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the\\nonly advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman\\na better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,\\nwhere there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be the happiest\\nof mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.\\nEvery thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman\\nat a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\\nby negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round\\nthe world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\\nher superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has\\nonly to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--\\nHe had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--\\nHe is a fortunate man indeed!\"\\n\\n\"You speak as if you envied him.\"\\n\\n\"And I do envy him, Emma.  In one respect he is the object of my envy.\"\\n\\nEmma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence\\nof Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,\\nif possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something\\ntotally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she\\nonly waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,\\nby saying,\\n\\n\"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,\\nI see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise.\\nEmma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it\\nunsaid the next moment.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then, don\\'t speak it, don\\'t speak it,\" she eagerly cried.\\n\"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\\nanother syllable followed.\\n\\nEmma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in her--\\nperhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;\\nshe might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him\\nhis own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,\\nwhich must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind\\nas his.--They had reached the house.\\n\\n\"You are going in, I suppose?\" said he.\\n\\n\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner\\nin which he still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn.\\nMr. Perry is not gone.\"  And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--\\n\"I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,\\ngave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me\\nas a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have\\nin contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will\\nhear whatever you like.  I will tell you exactly what I think.\"\\n\\n\"As a friend!\"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\"Emma, that I fear is\\na word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--\\nI have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--\\nExtraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you\\nas a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\"\\n\\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\\nof his eyes overpowered her.\\n\\n\"My dearest Emma,\" said he, \"for dearest you will always be,\\nwhatever the event of this hour\\'s conversation, my dearest,\\nmost beloved Emma--tell me at once.  Say `No,\\' if it is to be said.\"--\\nShe could really say nothing.--\"You are silent,\" he cried,\\nwith great animation; \"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"\\n\\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.\\nThe dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps\\nthe most prominent feeling.\\n\\n\"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\"  he soon resumed; and in a tone\\nof such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was\\ntolerably convincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able\\nto talk about it more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing\\nbut truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you\\nhave borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--\\nBear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as\\nyou have borne with them.  The manner, perhaps, may have as little\\nto recommend them.  God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--\\nBut you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--\\nand will return them if you can.  At present, I ask only to hear,\\nonce to hear your voice.\"\\n\\nWhile he spoke, Emma\\'s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\\nvelocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--\\nto catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\\nHarriet\\'s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,\\nas complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;\\nthat she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying\\nrelative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her\\nown feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,\\nher discouragement, had been all received as discouragement\\nfrom herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,\\nwith all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to\\nrejoice that Harriet\\'s secret had not escaped her, and to resolve\\nthat it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could\\nnow render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment\\nwhich might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection\\nfrom herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--\\nor even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him\\nat once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he\\ncould not marry them both, Emma had it not.  She felt for Harriet,\\nwith pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,\\nopposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.\\nShe had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to\\nher for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,\\nand as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such\\nalliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.  Her way was clear,\\nthough not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--\\nWhat did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.--\\nShe said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him\\nto say more himself.  He _had_ despaired at one period; he had received\\nsuch an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed\\nevery hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had\\nperhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,\\nher renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,\\nmight be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;\\nbut Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no\\nfarther explanation.\\n\\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\\nseldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,\\nor a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct\\nis mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--\\nMr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than\\nshe possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.\\nHe had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.\\nHe had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill\\'s\\nengagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,\\nif she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest\\nhad been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,\\non his feelings.  The delightful assurance of her total indifference\\ntowards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged\\nfrom him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain\\nher affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,\\nin the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be\\ntold that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior\\nhopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--\\nThe affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,\\nif he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed\\nfrom a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like\\nperfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\\n\\n_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the\\nsame precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each\\nthe same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,\\nthere had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,\\nor even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love\\nwith Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,\\none sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.\\nIt was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from\\nthe country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.\\nHe would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,\\nencouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--\\nBut he had gone to a wrong place.  There was too much domestic\\nhappiness in his brother\\'s house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;\\nIsabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\\ninferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,\\nfor much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\\nstayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning\\'s\\npost had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the\\ngladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,\\nhaving never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,\\nwas there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\\nthat he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;\\nand had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest\\nand best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,\\nbore the discovery.\\n\\nHe had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\\nHe heard her declare that she had never loved him.  Frank Churchill\\'s\\ncharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought\\nof Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort\\nof fellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house\\nfrom what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope\\nfor a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite\\nflutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed\\nmust still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.\\n\\nThey sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--\\nhow often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen\\non the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful\\neffect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,\\nnever in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could\\nsummon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,\\nor even the attentive daughter.\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him\\nin the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he\\nhave seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;\\nbut without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,\\nwithout the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in\\nthe looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably\\nall the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked\\non with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they\\ncould have told him in return.\\n\\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma\\'s fever continued;\\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised\\nand subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was\\nthe tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious\\npoints to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness\\nmust have some alloy.  Her father--and Harriet.  She could not be\\nalone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;\\nand how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.\\nWith respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.\\nShe hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short\\nparley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution\\nof never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,\\nas a sin of thought.  While he lived, it must be only an engagement;\\nbut she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\\ndrawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--\\nHow to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--\\nhow to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make\\nher any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--\\nOn these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--\\nand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter\\nreproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--\\nShe could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a\\nmeeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;\\nthat it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just\\nnow for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--\\nnearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\nfor her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--\\nShe did not think it in Harriet\\'s nature to escape being benefited\\nby novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--\\nAt any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,\\nfrom whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting\\nof the evil day, when they must all be together again.\\n\\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment\\nwhich left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,\\nin walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;\\nand half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again\\nwith him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate\\nher in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.\\n\\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have\\nthe slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter\\nwas brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed\\nwhat it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--\\nShe was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted\\nno explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--\\nand as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was\\nincapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.  She opened\\nthe packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,\\nushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.\\n\\n\"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding\\nto you the enclosed.  I know what thorough justice you will\\ndo it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think\\nwe shall never materially disagree about the writer again;\\nbut I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.--\\nThis letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have\\nbeen feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday,\\nbut it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being\\naffected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.--\\nI felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday\\nafternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing\\nlast night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\\n                              \"Yours ever,\\n                                                       \"A. W.\"\\n\\n                       [To Mrs. Weston.]\\n                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.\\nMY DEAR MADAM,\\n\\n\"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;\\nbut expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.--\\nYou are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even\\nall your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--\\nBut I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.\\nMy courage rises while I write.  It is very difficult for the\\nprosperous to be humble.  I have already met with such success\\nin two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking\\nmyself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have\\nhad any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend\\nthe exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls;\\nyou must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept\\nat all hazards.  This was the fact.  My right to place myself\\nin a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.\\nI shall not discuss it here.  For my temptation to _think_ it a right,\\nI refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,\\nand casements above, in Highbury.  I dared not address her openly;\\nmy difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well\\nknown to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,\\nbefore we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female\\nmind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--\\nHad she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,\\nwhat was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--\\nTo any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,\\nsudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.\\nEvery possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings\\nsecured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence.\\nIf you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,\\nof being your husband\\'s son, and the advantage of inheriting\\na disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses\\nor lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these\\ncircumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I\\nam conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.\\nYou will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax\\nwas in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you will\\nforgive me instantly; but I must work on my father\\'s compassion,\\nby reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house,\\nso long I lost the blessing of knowing you.  My behaviour,\\nduring the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not,\\nI hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.\\nAnd now I come to the principal, the only important part of my\\nconduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,\\nor requires very solicitous explanation.  With the greatest respect,\\nand the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father\\nperhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--\\nA few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion,\\nand some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\\nto Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--\\nIn order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led\\non to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy\\ninto which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss\\nWoodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe\\nthe declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,\\nI would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--\\nAmiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me\\nthe idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was\\nperfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much\\nmy conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,\\nfriendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\\nWe seemed to understand each other.  From our relative situation,\\nthose attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss\\nWoodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of\\nthat fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,\\nI remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,\\nand I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no\\ndoubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--\\nShe may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\\nhave penetrated a part.  I cannot doubt it.  You will find,\\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,\\nthat it did not take her wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave\\nme hints of it.  I remember her telling me at the ball, that I\\nowed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--\\nI hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted\\nby you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.\\nWhile you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,\\nI could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and procure\\nfor me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that\\nsaid Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,\\nas to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--\\nWhatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have\\nnow a key to.  My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get\\nmy body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--\\nOf the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,\\nthat its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would\\nnever have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--\\nThe delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,\\nmy dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.\\nYou will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--\\nNo description can describe her.  She must tell you herself what she is--\\nyet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would\\nso designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,\\nwhich will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--\\nShe gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,\\nI dare not depend.  I want to have your opinion of her looks.\\nI know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\\nPerhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;\\nI am impatient for a thousand particulars.  Remember how few\\nminutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:\\nand I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness\\nor misery.  When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with,\\nof her excellence and patience, and my uncle\\'s generosity, I am mad\\nwith joy:  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her,\\nand how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.\\nIf I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.\\nMy uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add\\nto this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought to hear.\\nI could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,\\nand, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out,\\nneeds explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you\\nwill conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,\\nI should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the\\nvery particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.\\nI should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have\\nfelt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--\\nBut I had no choice.  The hasty engagement she had entered into with\\nthat woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,\\nto recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,\\nand am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter\\nwhat it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect\\nfor me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners\\nto Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.\\n_She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of\\nconcealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;\\nI thought unreasonably so:  I thought her, on a thousand occasions,\\nunnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:  I thought her even cold.\\nBut she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued\\nmy spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\\nescaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\\nDo you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.  I was late;\\nI met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,\\nbut she would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me,\\nwhich I then thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing\\nin it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.\\nWhile I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one\\nhour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she\\nto be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\\nevery previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together\\nbetween Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--\\nI was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.\\nI doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by\\nsuch conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,\\nand such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her\\nresentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--\\nIn short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,\\nabominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,\\nthough I might have staid with you till the next morning,\\nmerely because I would be as angry with her as possible.  Even then,\\nI was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;\\nbut I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went\\naway determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall\\nalways congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.\\nHad you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would\\never have thought well of me again.  Its effect upon her appears\\nin the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she found I\\nwas really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\\nofficious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,\\nby the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.\\nI must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been\\nso richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known.--\\n`Jane,\\' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself\\nin calling her by that name, even to you.  Think, then, what I must\\nhave endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all\\nthe vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of\\nimaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--\\nShe closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,\\nand wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--\\n_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\\n_to_ _each_:  _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This letter reached me on the very\\nmorning of my poor aunt\\'s death.  I answered it within an hour;\\nbut from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business\\nfalling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all\\nthe many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;\\nand I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,\\nto satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather\\ndisappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;\\nbut I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--\\ntoo cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;\\nand two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters\\nall returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,\\nstating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply\\nto her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\\nnot be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both\\nto have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,\\nshe now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,\\nthat if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them\\nto Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period\\nto her at--:  in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge\\'s,\\nnear Bristol, stared me in the face.  I knew the name, the place,\\nI knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.\\nIt was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\\nwhich I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,\\nas to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive\\nof its anxious delicacy.  For the world would not she have seemed\\nto threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually\\ndetected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--\\nWhat was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle.\\nWithout his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--\\nI spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\\naway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\\nwholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!\\nwith a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness\\nin the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be\\nof a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must\\nhave suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while\\nall was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,\\nand saw how ill I had made her.  Do not pity me till I saw her wan,\\nsick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\\nknowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\\nof finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was\\nnot disappointed either in the object of my journey.  A great deal\\nof very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away.\\nBut it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,\\nand no moment\\'s uneasiness can ever occur between us again.  Now, my\\ndear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.\\nA thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\\never shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart\\nwill dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier\\nthan I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me\\nthe child of good fortune.  I hope she is right.--In one respect,\\nmy good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe\\nmyself,\\n                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,\\n                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nThis letter must make its way to Emma\\'s feelings.  She was obliged,\\nin spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do\\nit all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.  As soon as she\\ncame to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating\\nto herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;\\nand when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,\\nby the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the\\nvery strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at\\nthat moment.  She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;\\nand though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,\\nyet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,\\nand was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,\\nand so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,\\nthat there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,\\nshe must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\\n\\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\\nshe desired him to read it.  She was sure of Mrs. Weston\\'s wishing\\nit to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,\\nhad seen so much to blame in his conduct.\\n\\n\"I shall be very glad to look it over,\" said he; \"but it seems long.\\nI will take it home with me at night.\"\\n\\nBut that would not do.  Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,\\nand she must return it by him.\\n\\n\"I would rather be talking to you,\" he replied; \"but as it seems\\na matter of justice, it shall be done.\"\\n\\nHe began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \"Had I been offered\\nthe sight of one of this gentleman\\'s letters to his mother-in-law a few\\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\"\\n\\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,\\nwith a smile, observed, \"Humph! a fine complimentary opening:\\nBut it is his way.  One man\\'s style must not be the rule of another\\'s.\\nWe will not be severe.\"\\n\\n\"It will be natural for me,\" he added shortly afterwards, \"to speak my\\nopinion aloud as I read.  By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\\nIt will not be so great a loss of time:  but if you dislike it--\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I should wish it.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\\n\\n\"He trifles here,\" said he, \"as to the temptation.  He knows\\nhe is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought\\nnot to have formed the engagement.--`His father\\'s disposition:\\'--\\nhe is unjust, however, to his father.  Mr. Weston\\'s sanguine\\ntemper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;\\nbut Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured\\nto gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.\"\\n\\n\"And I have not forgotten,\" said Emma, \"how sure you were that he\\nmight have come sooner if he would.  You pass it over very handsomely--\\nbut you were perfectly right.\"\\n\\n\"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--\\nhad _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\"\\n\\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole\\nof it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;\\na shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;\\nor merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,\\nseriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--\\n\\n\"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most\\ndangerous game.  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--\\nNo judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his\\nown wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--\\nFancying you to have fathomed his secret.  Natural enough!--\\nhis own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it\\nin others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!\\nMy Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the\\nbeauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?\"\\n\\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet\\'s account,\\nwhich she could not give any sincere explanation of.\\n\\n\"You had better go on,\" said she.\\n\\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \"the pianoforte!\\nAh!  That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young\\nto consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much\\nexceed the pleasure.  A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot\\ncomprehend a man\\'s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection\\nwhich he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did\\nknow that she would have prevented the instrument\\'s coming if she could.\"\\n\\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause.\\nFrank Churchill\\'s confession of having behaved shamefully\\nwas the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.\\n\\n\"I perfectly agree with you, sir,\"--was then his remark.\\n\"You did behave very shamefully.  You never wrote a truer line.\"\\nAnd having gone through what immediately followed of the basis\\nof their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct\\nopposition to Jane Fairfax\\'s sense of right, he made a fuller pause\\nto say, \"This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,\\nfor his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,\\nand it should have been his first object to prevent her from\\nsuffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,\\nin carrying on the correspondence, than he could.  He should have\\nrespected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers\\nwere all reasonable.  We must look to her one fault, and remember\\nthat she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,\\nto bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment.\"\\n\\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,\\nand grew uncomfortable.  Her own behaviour had been so very improper!\\nShe was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look.\\nIt was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without\\nthe smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,\\ninstantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance\\nof Box Hill seemed to exist.\\n\\n\"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,\\nthe Eltons,\" was his next observation.--\"His feelings are natural.--\\nWhat! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt\\nthe engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--\\nshe dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of\\nhis behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he does,\" replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.\\n\"`Smallridge!\\'--What does this mean?  What is all this?\"\\n\\n\"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge\\'s children--\\na dear friend of Mrs. Elton\\'s--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and,\\nby the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even\\nof Mrs. Elton.  Only one page more.  I shall soon have done.\\nWhat a letter the man writes!\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding\\nher ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her.\\n`Dearer, much dearer than ever.\\'  I hope he may long continue to feel\\nall the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,\\nwith his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.\\'\\nCome, he knows himself there.  `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child\\nof good fortune.\\'--Those were Miss Woodhouse\\'s words, were they?--\\nAnd a fine ending--and there is the letter.  The child of good fortune!\\nThat was your name for him, was it?\"\\n\\n\"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;\\nbut still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better\\nof him for it.  I hope it does him some service with you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly it does.  He has had great faults, faults of\\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his\\nopinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves:\\nbut still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,\\nand will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly\\nwith her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,\\nand acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle\\nthat it wants.  And now, let me talk to you of something else.\\nI have another person\\'s interest at present so much at heart,\\nthat I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.  Ever since I\\nleft you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on\\none subject.\"\\n\\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,\\nsuch as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,\\nhow to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\\nhappiness of her father.  Emma\\'s answer was ready at the first word.\\n\"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\\nfor her.  She could never quit him.\"  Part only of this answer,\\nhowever, was admitted.  The impossibility of her quitting her father,\\nMr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility\\nof any other change, he could not agree to.  He had been thinking\\nit over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce\\nMr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe\\nit feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer\\nhim to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,\\nthat such a transplantation would be a risk of her father\\'s comfort,\\nperhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.  Mr. Woodhouse\\ntaken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.\\nBut the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted\\nhis dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as\\nher father\\'s happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield\\nto continue her home, it should be his likewise.\\n\\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own\\npassing thoughts.  Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;\\nbut such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.\\nShe was sensible of all the affection it evinced.  She felt that,\\nin quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence\\nof hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,\\nand in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,\\nto be borne with.  She promised to think of it, and advised him\\nto think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection\\ncould alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.  He had\\ngiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;\\nhe had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,\\nto have his thoughts to himself.\\n\\n\"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\" cried Emma.  \"I am\\nsure William Larkins will not like it.  You must get his consent\\nbefore you ask mine.\"\\n\\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,\\nto think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.\\n\\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view\\nin which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights\\nas heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.\\nThink she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;\\nand yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,\\nand found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent\\ndislike of Mr. Knightley\\'s marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,\\nwhich at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of\\nthe sister and the aunt.\\n\\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--\\nthe more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,\\ntheir mutual good to outweigh every drawback.  Such a companion\\nfor herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--\\nSuch a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be\\ngiving increase of melancholy!\\n\\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every\\nblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings\\nof her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.\\nThe delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,\\npoor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a\\ndistance from.  She would be a loser in every way.  Emma could not\\ndeplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.\\nIn such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;\\nbut for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.\\n\\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.\\nMr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--\\nnot like Mr. Elton.  Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,\\nso truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be\\nless worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even\\nof Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men\\nin one year.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous\\nas herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter.  How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\\n\\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\\nwithout reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\\nher style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\\nIt might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\\n\\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella\\'s invitation;\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\\nwithout resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\\nHarriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.\\nMrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill\\nhealth was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a\\ndentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\\nunder her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister\\'s side,\\nEmma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--\\nHarriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\\nto be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse\\'s carriage.--It was all arranged,\\nit was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.\\n\\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley\\'s visits; now she\\ncould talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,\\nwhich had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\\nnear her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,\\nbe enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.\\n\\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard\\'s, or in London, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma\\'s sensations; but she could not\\nthink of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\\n\\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication\\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--\\nthe confession of her engagement to her father; but she would\\nhave nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer\\nthe disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional\\nagitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--\\nand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\\nappointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,\\nto crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.\\n\\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half\\nan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--\\nShe ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of\\ntheir present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.\\nIt would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a\\nsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\\nwhich she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.\\n\\nShe went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor\\nJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--\\nThe fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured\\nof their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--\\nShe heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nMiss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of, \"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly\\nforward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--\\nEmma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.\\nThere was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\\nfeeling tone,\\n\\n\"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible\\nfor me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being\\nso entirely without words.\"\\n\\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,\\nif the sound of Mrs. Elton\\'s voice from the sitting-room had not\\nchecked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\\nand all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest\\nshake of the hand.\\n\\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,\\nwhich accounted for the previous tranquillity.  Emma could have\\nwished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience\\nwith every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,\\nshe hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.\\n\\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton\\'s thoughts,\\nand understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;\\nit was being in Miss Fairfax\\'s confidence, and fancying herself\\nacquainted with what was still a secret to other people.\\nEmma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;\\nand while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\\nto attend to the good old lady\\'s replies, she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\\nbeen reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple\\nand gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\\n\\n\"We can finish this some other time, you know.  You and I shall\\nnot want opportunities.  And, in fact, you have heard all the\\nessential already.  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits\\nour apology, and is not offended.  You see how delightfully\\nshe writes.  Oh! she is a sweet creature!  You would have doated\\non her, had you gone.--But not a word more.  Let us be discreet--\\nquite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--\\nI forget the poem at this moment:\\n\\n        \"For when a lady\\'s in the case,\\n        \"You know all other things give place.\"\\n\\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word\\nto the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an\\'t I?  But I want\\nto set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see,\\nhas quite appeased her.\"\\n\\nAnd again, on Emma\\'s merely turning her head to look\\nat Mrs. Bates\\'s knitting, she added, in a half whisper,\\n\\n\"I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as\\na minister of state.  I managed it extremely well.\"\\n\\nEmma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\npossible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony\\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\\n\\n\"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the\\nhighest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)\\nUpon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--\\nOh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\"--\\nAnd when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,\\n\"We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have;\\nnot a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;\\nPerry shall have all the credit.\"\\n\\n\"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\"\\nshe shortly afterwards began, \"since the party to Box Hill.\\nVery pleasant party.  But yet I think there was something wanting.\\nThings did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon\\nthe spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might\\nbe mistaken.  However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one\\nto go again.  What say you both to our collecting the same party,\\nand exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--\\nIt must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,\\nnot _one_ exception.\"\\n\\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted\\nby the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,\\nfrom doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.\\n\\n\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\\nto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane\\'s prospects--\\nthat is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--\\nHow is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--\\nSuch a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--\\nCharming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--\\nsuch attention to Jane!\"--And from her great, her more than commonly\\nthankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed\\nthat there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,\\nfrom the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--\\nAfter a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,\\nMrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,\\nthat anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;\\nbut, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.\\nHe promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.\"\\n\\n\"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--\\nThat will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like\\nmorning visits, and Mr. Elton\\'s time is so engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning\\nto night.--There is no end of people\\'s coming to him, on some pretence\\nor other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,\\nare always wanting his opinion.  They seem not able to do any thing\\nwithout him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,\\' I often say, `rather you than I.--\\nI do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,\\nif I had half so many applicants.\\'--Bad enough as it is, for I\\nabsolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe\\nI have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,\\nI assure you:  yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.\"  And putting\\nup her hand to screen her words from Emma--\"A congratulatory visit,\\nyou know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily!--\\n\\n\"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\\nfrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together\\nin deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley\\'s right hand.\"\\n\\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \"Is Mr. Elton\\ngone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.\\nWeston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only\\nof those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing\\ntheir own way.\"\\n\\n\"Have not you mistaken the day?\" said Emma.  \"I am almost certain\\nthat the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley\\nwas at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\" was the abrupt answer,\\nwhich denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton\\'s side.--\\n\"I do believe,\" she continued, \"this is the most troublesome parish\\nthat ever was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"Your parish there was small,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\\ntalked of.\"\\n\\n\"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;\\nthe only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you clever creature, that\\'s very true.  What a thinking brain\\nyou have!  I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,\\nif we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity\\nwould produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,\\nthat _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--\\nnot a word, if you please.\"\\n\\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,\\nwas very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\\n\\nMr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some\\nof her sparkling vivacity.\\n\\n\"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--\\nBut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.\\nYou knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--\\nHere have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies\\na sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,\\nhow soon it may be wanted?\"\\n\\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,\\nand the walk he had had for nothing.\\n\\n\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found.\\nVery odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,\\nand the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home\\ntill one.\"\\n\\n\"Donwell!\" cried his wife.--\"My dear Mr. E., you have not been\\nto Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, that\\'s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\\nto-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--\\nI went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)\\nwhich made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home!\\nI assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message\\nfor me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--\\nVery extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.\\nPerhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--\\nMiss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you\\nexplain it?\"\\n\\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine,\" said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\\nought to do,) \"I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,\\nof all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect\\nto be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,\\nI am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--\\nand his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case:\\nand very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,\\nI have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I\\nwould not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard\\nfor any consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds\\nher very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never\\nsent it.\"\\n\\n\"I met William Larkins,\" continued Mr. Elton, \"as I got near\\nthe house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,\\nbut I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.\\nHe did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he\\ncould hardly ever get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with\\nWilliam\\'s wants, but it really is of very great importance that _I_\\nshould see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,\\nof very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk\\nto no purpose.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.\\nIn all probability she was at this very time waited for there;\\nand Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression\\ntowards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\\n\\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined\\nto attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;\\nit gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,\\nto say,\\n\\n\"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.\\nHad you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been\\ntempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more\\nopenly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should\\ncertainly have been impertinent.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her\\nusual composure--\"there would have been no danger.  The danger\\nwould have been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified\\nme more than by expressing an interest--.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,\\n(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I\\nhave of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly\\nconsoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good\\nopinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a\\ndegree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say.\\nI long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.\\nI feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately--in short, if your\\ncompassion does not stand my friend--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\" cried Emma warmly,\\nand taking her hand.  \"You owe me no apologies; and every body to\\nwhom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,\\nso delighted even--\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--\\nSo cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life\\nof deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\"\\n\\n\"Pray say no more.  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\\nLet us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be\\ndone quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.\\nI hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?\"\\n\\n\"Very.\"\\n\\n\"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--\\njust as I begin to know you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.\\nI am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\" replied Emma,\\nsmiling--\"but, excuse me, it must be thought of.\"\\n\\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\\n\\n\"You are very right; it has been thought of.  And I will own\\nto you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living\\nwith Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be\\nthree months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,\\nI imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--\\nOh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!--\\nGood-bye, good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Weston\\'s friends were all made happy by her safety;\\nand if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased\\nto Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.\\nShe had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.  She would\\nnot acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match\\nfor her, hereafter, with either of Isabella\\'s sons; but she was\\nconvinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.\\nIt would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--\\nand even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have\\nhis fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\\nand the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--\\nno one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it\\nwould be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,\\nshould not have their powers in exercise again.\\n\\n\"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\"\\nshe continued--\"like La Baronne d\\'Almane on La Comtesse d\\'Ostalis,\\nin Madame de Genlis\\' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see\\nher own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\"\\n\\n\"That is,\" replied Mr. Knightley, \"she will indulge her even more\\nthan she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.\\nIt will be the only difference.\"\\n\\n\"Poor child!\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable\\nin infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.  I am losing\\nall my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.\\nI, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible\\ningratitude in me to be severe on them?\"\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied:  \"But I had the assistance of all\\nyour endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.\\nI doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:--\\nMiss Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well.\\nMy interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was\\nvery natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--\\nand I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done\\nin a disagreeable manner.  I do not believe I did you any good.\\nThe good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest\\naffection to me.  I could not think about you so much without doating\\non you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\\nhave been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you were of use to me,\" cried Emma.  \"I was very often\\ninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.\\nI am very sure you did me good.  And if poor little Anna Weston is\\nto be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much\\nfor her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her\\nwhen she is thirteen.\"\\n\\n\"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one\\nof your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;\\npapa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor\\'s leave\\'--something which,\\nyou knew, I did not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving\\nyou two bad feelings instead of one.\"\\n\\n\"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold\\nmy speeches in such affectionate remembrance.\"\\n\\n\"`Mr. Knightley.\\'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;\\' and,\\nfrom habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.\\nI want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.\"\\n\\n\"I remember once calling you `George,\\' in one of my amiable fits,\\nabout ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you;\\nbut, as you made no objection, I never did it again.\"\\n\\n\"And cannot you call me `George\\' now?\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.\\'\\nI will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,\\nby calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,\" she added presently,\\nlaughing and blushing--\"I will promise to call you once by your\\nChristian name.  I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess\\nwhere;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.\"\\n\\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one\\nimportant service which his better sense would have rendered her,\\nto the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all\\nher womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;\\nbut it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--\\nHarriet was very seldom mentioned between them.  This, on his side,\\nmight merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma\\nwas rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,\\nfrom some appearances, that their friendship were declining.\\nShe was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,\\nthey certainly should have corresponded more, and that her\\nintelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,\\non Isabella\\'s letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain\\nof being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little\\ninferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\\n\\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could\\nbe expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\\nwhich appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to\\nbe consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not\\nappear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--\\nIsabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet\\nhad not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have\\nescaped her.  Emma\\'s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on,\\nby Harriet\\'s being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be\\na month at least.  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down\\nin August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.\\n\\n\"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\"Here is his answer, if you like to see it.\"\\n\\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.\\nEmma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive\\nto know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing\\nthat her friend was unmentioned.\\n\\n\"John enters like a brother into my happiness,\" continued Mr. Knightley,\\n\"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\\nlikewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from\\nmaking flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\\ncool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"\\n\\n\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read\\nthe letter.  \"I honour his sincerity.  It is very plain that he\\nconsiders the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,\\nbut that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy\\nof your affection, as you think me already.  Had he said any thing\\nto bear a different construction, I should not have believed him.\"\\n\\n\"My Emma, he means no such thing.  He only means--\"\\n\\n\"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\"\\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\"much less, perhaps,\\nthan he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve\\non the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Emma, my dear Emma--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she cried with more thorough gaiety, \"if you fancy your\\nbrother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in\\nthe secret, and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much\\nfarther from doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness,\\nall the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit\\non mine.  I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma\\' with him at once.--\\nHis tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\\nas John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\\nto be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John\\'s letter--\\ndid you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take\\nhim wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing\\nsomething of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\\nsome thoughts of marrying.  He had no idea of me.  He seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into\\nmy feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious\\nof any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare\\nhim at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--\\nBut it was so, I suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I\\nwas staying with them the other day.  I believe I did not play\\nwith the children quite so much as usual.  I remember one evening\\nthe poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.\\'\"\\n\\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons\\'\\nreception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse\\'s visits, Emma having it in view\\nthat her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,\\nresolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--\\nBut how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself\\nto do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley\\'s absence, or when it\\ncame to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must\\nhave put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,\\nand follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced\\nto speak, and to speak cheerfully too.  She must not make it a more\\ndecided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits\\nshe could command, she prepared him first for something strange,\\nand then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation\\ncould be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with\\nno difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--\\nshe and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield\\nwould receive the constant addition of that person\\'s company\\nwhom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,\\nbest in the world.\\n\\nPoor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it.  She was reminded, more than once,\\nof having always said she would never marry, and assured that it\\nwould be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of\\npoor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung\\nabout him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that\\nhe must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\\ntaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:\\nbut she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;\\nshe was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but\\nfor the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal\\nthe happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once\\ngot used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--\\nHe would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want\\nto consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,\\nwho so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--\\nWho so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he\\nlike to have him always on the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true.\\nMr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see\\nhim every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could\\nnot they go on as they had done?\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--\\nTo Emma\\'s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley\\'s,\\nwhose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;\\nand he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--\\nThey had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters\\nof the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,\\non the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most\\nserviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--\\nwell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\\nto Mr. Woodhouse\\'s mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;\\nand every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\\nit would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself\\nwhich almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--\\nin another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad\\nif the marriage did take place.\\n\\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;\\nbut she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had\\nno scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard\\nfor Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;\\nand it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable\\na connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,\\nso peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed\\nas if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,\\nand that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\\nthought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men\\nin a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own\\nhome for Hartfield!  And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear\\nwith Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--\\nThe difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always\\nfelt in her husband\\'s plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank\\nand Emma.  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had\\nbeen a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than\\nby herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject\\nbetter than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of themselves;\\nthe young people will find a way.\"  But here there was nothing to be\\nshifted off in a wild speculation on the future.  It was all right,\\nall open, all equal.  No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\\nIt was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,\\nand without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\\n\\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing\\ncould increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would\\nsoon have outgrown its first set of caps.\\n\\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;\\nand Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes\\nwere enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--\\nHe saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all\\nthe constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;\\nand by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he\\nhad always foreseen it.\\n\\n\"It is to be a secret, I conclude,\" said he.  \"These matters are\\nalways a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.\\nOnly let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has\\nany suspicion.\"\\n\\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on\\nthat point.  He told her the news.  Was not she like a daughter,\\nhis eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,\\nit passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,\\nimmediately afterwards.  It was no more than the principals were\\nprepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known\\nat Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking\\nof themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,\\nwith great sagacity.\\n\\nIn general, it was a very well approved match.  Some might think him,\\nand others might think her, the most in luck.  One set might\\nrecommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield\\nfor the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements\\namong their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious\\nobjection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,\\nthe surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton\\ncared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the\\nyoung lady\\'s pride would now be contented;\" and supposed \"she had\\nalways meant to catch Knightley if she could;\" and, on the point\\nof living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \"Rather he than I!\"--\\nBut Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor Knightley!\\npoor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;\\nfor, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--\\nHow could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--\\nnot in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--\\nPoor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_.\\nOh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on\\nevery thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry\\nthat she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,\\nliving together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple\\nGrove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end\\nof the first quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nTime passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London\\nwould be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking\\nof it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\\ngrieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts\\nwere put by.  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;\\nand then, in a graver tone, began with,\\n\\n\"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\"\\n\\n\"Good or bad?\" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\\n\\n\"I do not know which it ought to be called.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying\\nnot to smile.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" said he, composing his features, \"I am very much afraid,\\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which\\npleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\"\\n\\n\"There is one subject,\" he replied, \"I hope but one, on which\\nwe do not think alike.\"  He paused a moment, again smiling,\\nwith his eyes fixed on her face.  \"Does nothing occur to you?--\\nDo not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.\"\\n\\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\\nthough she knew not what.\\n\\n\"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?\" cried he.\\n\"You have, I believe, and know the whole.\"\\n\\n\"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\"\\n\\n\"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.\\nHarriet Smith marries Robert Martin.\"\\n\\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--\\nand her eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\"\\nbut her lips were closed.\\n\\n\"It is so, indeed,\" continued Mr. Knightley; \"I have it from Robert\\nMartin himself.  He left me not half an hour ago.\"\\n\\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\\n\\n\"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\\nthe same.  But in time they will.  Time, you may be sure, will make\\none or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,\\nwe need not talk much on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\" she replied, exerting herself.\\n\"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,\\nbut I cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean\\nto say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot\\nmean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean,\\nthat he intends it.\"\\n\\n\"I mean that he has done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling\\nbut determined decision, \"and been accepted.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" she cried.--\"Well!\"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the\\nexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\\nmust be expressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing;\\nmake this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.\\nI never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,\\nI assure you.--How--how has it been possible?\"\\n\\n\"It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days ago,\\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting\\nto send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,\\nand was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley\\'s.\\nThey were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley\\'s. The party\\nwas to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.\\nMy friend Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way;\\nwere all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with\\nthem the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit\\n(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;\\nand certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,\\nas happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday\\'s coach,\\nand was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report\\nhis proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.\\nThis is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.\\nYour friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--\\nShe will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman\\'s\\nlanguage can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only\\nin the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin\\'s heart seemed\\nfor _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\\nwithout its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\\nbox at Astley\\'s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley\\nand little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\\nrather uneasy.\"\\n\\nHe stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,\\nshe was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\\nof happiness.  She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.\\nHer silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,\\nhe added,\\n\\n\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make\\nyou unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.\\nHis situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies\\nyour friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better\\nof him as you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would\\ndelight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your\\nfriend in better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could,\\nwhich is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me\\nabout William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"\\n\\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself\\nnot to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\\n\\n\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think\\nHarriet is doing extremely well.  _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_.\\nIn respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.\\nI have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.\\nYou cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\\nunprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him, much more, than she was before.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley;\\n\"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,\\nnot likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told\\nher he loved her.\"\\n\\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word,\\nI believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,\\nare you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\\n_accepted_ him.  I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--\\nDid not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;\\nof business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,\\nin the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not\\nHarriet\\'s hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some\\nfamous ox.\"\\n\\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma\\'s feelings,\\nand so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\\npassed on Harriet\\'s side, so fresh the sound of those words,\\nspoken with such emphasis, \"No, I hope I know better than to think\\nof Robert Martin,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence\\nto prove, in some measure, premature.  It could not be otherwise.\\n\\n\"Do you dare say this?\" cried Mr. Knightley.  \"Do you dare to suppose\\nme so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--\\nWhat do you deserve?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put\\nup with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,\\ndirect answer.  Are you quite sure that you understand the terms\\non which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?\"\\n\\n\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he\\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,\\nnothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you\\na proof that it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he\\nwas now to do.  He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he\\ncould apply for information of her relations or friends.  Could I\\nmention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?\\nI assured him that I could not.  Then, he said, he would endeavour\\nto see her in the course of this day.\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\\n\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\"\\n\\n\"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\"\\n\\n\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\nHarriet\\'s good qualities.  I have taken some pains for your sake,\\nand for Robert Martin\\'s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe\\nas much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.\\nI have often talked to her a good deal.  You must have seen that\\nI did.  Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me\\nof pleading poor Martin\\'s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing\\nher happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--\\nMuch of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah! poor Harriet!\"\\n\\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little\\nmore praise than she deserved.\\n\\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\\nher father.  She was not sorry.  She wanted to be alone.  Her mind\\nwas in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her\\nto be collected.  She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;\\nand till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed\\nand reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.\\n\\nHer father\\'s business was to announce James\\'s being gone out to put\\nthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;\\nand she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\\n\\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations\\nmay be imagined.  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\\nprospect of Harriet\\'s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for security.--What had she to wish for?  Nothing, but to\\ngrow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own.  Nothing, but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.\\n\\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst\\nof them.  She must laugh at such a close!  Such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back!  Such a heart--such a Harriet!\\n\\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would\\nbe a pleasure.  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\\n\\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nMr. Knightley would soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation,\\nmystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.\\nShe could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.\\n\\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;\\nnot always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;\\nand, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,\\nor poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.\\n\\nThey arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--\\nbut hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse\\nreceived the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse\\nwas caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.\\n\\n\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.  \"I was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning.  He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"\\n\\nIn half a minute they were in the room.  Emma was extremely glad\\nto see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of\\nembarrassing recollections on each side.  They met readily and smiling,\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;\\nand having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,\\nwhich she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,\\nand of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.\\nWhen Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby\\nwas fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--\\nor of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her\\nand say,\\n\\n\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving\\nmessage in one of Mrs. Weston\\'s letters.  I hope time has not made\\nyou less willing to pardon.  I hope you do not retract what you\\nthen said.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.\\nI am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give\\nyou joy in person.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\\n\\n\"Is not she looking well?\" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\\n\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and\\nMrs. Weston doat upon her.\"\\n\\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,\\nafter mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named\\nthe name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced\\nin her hearing.\\n\\n\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"\\n\\n\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.  Early, I know,\\nyou had none.\"\\n\\n\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I had--\\nit would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,\\nthey were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--\\nIt would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond\\nof secrecy and told you every thing.\"\\n\\n\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.\\n\\n\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle\\'s being persuaded\\nto pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.\\nWhen the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,\\nand continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,\\nI am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--\\nTill this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.\\nDo not you pity me?\"\\n\\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession\\nof gay thought, he cried,\\n\\n\"Ah! by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for\\nthe moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\"  He paused.--She coloured\\nand laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember\\nmy wish in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.--\\nI assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest\\nand satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"\\n\\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;\\nbut his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\\nown Jane, and his next words were,\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--\\nand yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.\\nIt is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--\\na most distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.--\\nJust colour enough for beauty.\"\\n\\n\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do not\\nI remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--\\nWhen we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\\n\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could\\nnot help saying,\\n\\n\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--\\nI am sure it was a consolation to you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?\\nI was the most miserable wretch!\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.  I am sure it\\nwas a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking\\nus all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell\\nyou the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself\\nin the same situation.  I think there is a little likeness between us.\"\\n\\nHe bowed.\\n\\n\"If not in our dispositions,\" she presently added, with a look of\\ntrue sensibility, \"there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny\\nwhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior\\nto our own.\"\\n\\n\"True, true,\" he answered, warmly.  \"No, not true on your side.  You can\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.\\nLook at her.  Is not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the turn\\nof her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--\\nYou will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)\\nthat my uncle means to give her all my aunt\\'s jewels.  They are to be\\nnew set.  I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.\\nWill not it be beautiful in her dark hair?\"\\n\\n\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,\\nthat he gratefully burst out,\\n\\n\"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such\\nexcellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.\\nI should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\"\\n\\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an\\naccount of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,\\nfrom the infant\\'s appearing not quite well.  She believed she had\\nbeen foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half\\na minute of sending for Mr. Perry.  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,\\nbut Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,\\nhowever, the child had been perfectly well again.  This was\\nher history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwho commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,\\nand only regretted that she had not done it.  \"She should always send\\nfor Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,\\nwere it only for a moment.  She could not be too soon alarmed,\\nnor send for Perry too often.  It was a pity, perhaps, that he\\nhad not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry\\nhad seen it.\"\\n\\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\\n\\n\"Perry!\" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\nFairfax\\'s eye.  \"My friend Mr. Perry!  What are they saying\\nabout Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does\\nhe travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?\"\\n\\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined\\nin the laugh, it was evident from Jane\\'s countenance that she\\ntoo was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\\n\\n\"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\" he cried.  \"I can never think\\nof it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.\\nI see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.\\nLook at her.  Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage\\nof her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to\\nnothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?\"\\n\\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,\\nlow, yet steady voice,\\n\\n\"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--\\nThey _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\"\\n\\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;\\nbut Emma\\'s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on\\nleaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,\\nshe felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never\\nbeen more sensible of Mr. Knightley\\'s high superiority of character.\\nThe happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.\\nA very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,\\nthan she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--\\nthat Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\\n\\nHarriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,\\nand self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\\nher friend\\'s approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\\nHarriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nAstley\\'s, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight.  But what did such particulars explain?--\\nThe fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had\\nalways liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible\\nto Emma.\\n\\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet\\'s parentage became known.\\nShe proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood\\nof gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--\\nIt was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many\\na gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nMr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--\\nThe stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,\\nwould have been a stain indeed.\\n\\nNo objection was raised on the father\\'s side; the young man was\\ntreated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became\\nacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could bid fairest for her little friend.  She had no doubt\\nof Harriet\\'s happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,\\nand in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,\\nof security, stability, and improvement.  She would be placed in the\\nmidst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\\nretired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.\\nShe would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.\\nShe would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be\\nthe luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and\\npersevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,\\nto yield only to herself.\\n\\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--\\nThe intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must\\nchange into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought\\nto be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,\\nnatural manner.\\n\\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,\\nas no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood\\nbefore them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she\\nscarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the\\naltar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,\\nthe latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.\\n\\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\\n\\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,\\nby Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage\\nought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,\\nto allow them the fortnight\\'s absence in a tour to the seaside,\\nwhich was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,\\nwere agreed in approving it.  But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse\\nto be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their\\nmarriage but as a distant event.\\n\\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they\\nwere almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--\\nHe began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--\\na very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.\\nStill, however, he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,\\nthat his daughter\\'s courage failed.  She could not bear to see\\nhim suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though\\nher understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the\\nMr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress\\nwould be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.\\n\\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--\\nMrs. Weston\\'s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--\\nevidently by the ingenuity of man.  Other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to\\nMr. Woodhouse\\'s fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense\\nof his son-in-law\\'s protection, would have been under wretched alarm\\nevery night of his life.  The strength, resolution, and presence\\nof mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.\\nWhile either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--\\nBut Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the\\nfirst week in November.\\n\\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at\\nthe moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was\\ncalled on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert\\nMartin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\\n\\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties\\nhave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the\\nparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,\\nand very inferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin, very few\\nlace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she\\nheard of it.\"--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,\\nthe hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band\\nof true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered\\nin the perfect happiness of the union.\\n\\n\\nFINIS\\n[Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818]\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\nSir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,\\nfor his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;\\nthere he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a\\ndistressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and\\nrespect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;\\nthere any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs\\nchanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over\\nthe almost endless creations of the last century; and there,\\nif every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history\\nwith an interest which never failed.  This was the page at which\\nthe favourite volume always opened:\\n\\n           \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\n\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,\\nborn June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,\\nNovember 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\n\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands;\\nbut Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth--\\n\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles\\nMusgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\"\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\nhe had lost his wife.\\n\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,\\nin the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments,\\nexertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year\\nof Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with\\nthe arms and motto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county\\nof Somerset,\" and Sir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\n\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of\\nthe second Sir Walter.\"\\n\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character;\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome\\nin his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\nFew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion.\\n\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.\\n--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\nShe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\nclose by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\nLady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters.\\n\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years\\nhad passed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\nthe other a widow.\\n\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\nBe it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\nFor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had succeeded,\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\nmost happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.\\nMary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\nMrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--\\nshe was only Anne.\\n\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all;\\nbut it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\nto excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\nAll equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\nElizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\n\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\nabout Lady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\nLady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\nThirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  She had\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\nand pushed it away.\\n\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\nthe remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter\\nElliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\n\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\nHe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death,\\nSir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\nMr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\nand Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\nThe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth.\\n\\nSir Walter has resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\"\\nhe observed, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\nthe House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\nas Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased.\\n\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval\\nof several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\nElliot\\'s eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\nYet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\nThe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\nThis could not be pardoned.\\n\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.\\nShe knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\nMr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,\\nbut not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\nfrom his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?\\nDoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\nHe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\n\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\n\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\nShe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\nShe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  Herself the widow of\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\nand Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\nvery dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,\\nas being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\n\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\nand that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\nWhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\nhave done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\nas it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.\\nWe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\nhis friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\nShe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated\\nLady Russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\nthan to half a reformation.  Her knowledge of her father\\nand Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\nthrough the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\n\\nHow Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence.  Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all:\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort\\nof life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--\\ncontractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner\\nquit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s retrenching,\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him\\nthat Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\nIn any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house\\nin the country.  All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\nA small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\nLady Russell\\'s society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object\\nof her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\nShe disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\nand Bath was to be her home.\\n\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath\\nover London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\nof Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes.\\nIt would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne\\'s\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\n\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\nby passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,\\ntoo little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society\\nwould improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.\\n\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\nwhich stronger heads than Sir Walter\\'s have found too much.\\nKellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\n\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\nthe additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\nat Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\nthat Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\n\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\nthan because Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\nagainst previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\nbut always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\\nthis selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\n\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\n\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd\\none morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be\\nall wanting a home.  Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\nMany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  If a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\\n\\n\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter;\\n\"that\\'s all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\never so many before; hey, Shepherd?\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  Therefore, Sir Walter,\\nwhat I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,\\nmight conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\nI venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\nin the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\n\\nSir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\nnothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay\\'s health as a drive to Kellynch:\\n\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\nThe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now.  You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\n\\n\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\\nto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\nThe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\nis another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,\\nI assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"In all these cases, there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\nYour interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\nI venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.\"\\n\\nHere Anne spoke--\\n\\n\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\"\\nwas Mr Shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\nbut Sir Walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.\\nA man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\nany other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company\\nwith two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;\\nLord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\nwithout bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,\\nand a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `In the name of heaven,\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\n(Sir Basil Morley).  `Old fellow!\\' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin.\\nWhat do you take his age to be?\\'  `Sixty,\\' said I, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\n`Forty,\\' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.\\'  Picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.\\nI never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\nbut to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin\\'s age.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\nHave a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\\nThe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\nI have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\nSoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\neffect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\nI know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\nSir Walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,\\nhe had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.\\nBy the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,\\nAdmiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\nand had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\nMr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,\\nand understanding his (Mr Shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\nand mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,\\nI believe, several years.\"\\n\\n\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\nif Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the Admiral\\'s family, which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  A house was\\nnever taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\nA lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over.\\n\\n\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\\nand taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\\nwith business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\\nshe told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at Monkford.  Bless me! what was his name?\\nAt this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.\\nPenelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at Monkford:  Mrs Croft\\'s brother?\"\\n\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember\\nno gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"\\n\\n\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\\nI remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\\ncaught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nAfter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.\\nHe had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,\\nfor two or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.\\nYou remember him, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.\\nYou misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.\\nOne wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\\nno service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\nthey had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of Sir Walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nIt succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\nhe was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\nand authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained\\nat Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nSir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\nin all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\nSo far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing, in the Admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\"\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;\\na Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\na note of explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence,\\nand, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\\nIn all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence.\\n\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\\nwith a gentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps,\\nmay be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,\\nhis brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,\\nin the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\\nfor half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\nand Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\nand feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\nThey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\ndeeply in love.  It would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\nhaving them accepted.\\n\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\nTroubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\nHe thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nAnne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few,\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\nyouth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\nBut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\nHe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\nSuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;\\nbut Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\nShe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nSuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\nAnne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\nbut Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\nof success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had left the country\\nin consequence.\\n\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended Anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\nHer attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\n\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\nin change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  No one had ever\\ncome within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\nFrederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  No second attachment,\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\naround them.  She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had\\nlamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\nonly to Sir Walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\nand however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,\\nwhile Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\nBut in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\nand though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for Anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nThey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of Anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame\\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\nShe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,\\nall his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\nHe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\nHe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\nShe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\nshe could not hear that Captain Wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\nto live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\nShe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\\nand their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority\\nof Lady Russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft\\'s really\\ntaking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\n\\nThe sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards.\\n\\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s seeing Kellynch Hall,\\nAnne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell\\'s,\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\n\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\nand decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\non the Admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by Mr Shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\nto the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\n\\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\nand Mr Shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\n\"This indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\nand the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.\\nThe Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be\\nno harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\nesteemed about equal.\\n\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nLady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\\nof Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others.\\n\\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\nMary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\nUppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\ninstead of going to Bath.\\n\\n\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary\\'s reasoning;\\nand Elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay,\\nfor nobody will want her in Bath.\"\\n\\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nThis invitation of Mary\\'s removed all Lady Russell\\'s difficulties,\\nand it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\\ntill Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\\n\\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, Mrs Clay\\'s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,\\nin Mrs Clay\\'s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\n\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.\\nWith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope\\nof success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\n\\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\nand as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\nI can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,\\nI really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were\\na very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor\\nMrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\nthough I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her\\'s\\nand those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\nbut he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice\\nMrs Clay\\'s freckles.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne,\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\nalter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\n\\nAnne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\n\\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\\nMiss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.  The party drove off in very good spirits;\\nSir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\\nand Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\\nto the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\nand be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,\\nand Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage\\nof Lady Russell\\'s journey.\\n\\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old English style, containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\nfor his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,\\nFrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nHere Anne had often been staying.  She knew the ways of Uppercross\\nas well as those of Kellynch.  The two families were so continually meeting,\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house\\nat all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;\\nbut being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course.  Though better endowed than the elder sister,\\nMary had not Anne\\'s understanding nor temper.  While well, and happy,\\nand properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely.  She had no resources\\nfor solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  In person, she was\\ninferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\\nthe dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  She was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\\nand two children; and, on Anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.\\nI am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning!\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\\nat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\\nas I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\nand not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.\\nI do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nAnne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\n\"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\nHe would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\nI assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind\\na word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.\\n\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours\\nat the Great House?\"\\n\\n\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,\\nexcept Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,\\nnot one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit\\nthe Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves\\nout of their way.\"\\n\\n\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\nIt is early.\"\\n\\n\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\nYou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:\\nand besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,\\nhave had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\\nleft Kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect\\nin a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\nI have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth\\'s plants\\nare for Lady Russell.  I have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\nand one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\nI was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up\\na great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  It would have been strange\\nif I had not gone.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were\\nso crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\nand Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into\\nthe back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non Anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on Mary\\'s.  She could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it,\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the Great House before they have\\nbeen to see you?\"\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.\\n\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\\nso well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\nThey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\nneither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old\\nEnglish style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\nTheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\nAnne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nThey were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the Great House family, which was generally,\\nas Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe Miss Musgroves, at Mary\\'s particular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\nShe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\nor without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\nwhich at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:\\n\"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\n\"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\nQueen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--\\n\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at Bath!\"\\n\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.\\n\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\nWith the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\nand all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.\\n\\nShe had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\nAnne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\nHe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to Anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\nfor a happy couple.  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\nfor while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them\\nvery well, if it were not for Mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\nAnne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\nbut when listening in turn to Mary\\'s reproach of \"Charles spoils\\nthe children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\"\\n\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\nKnown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\n\"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\nwas Charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:\\n\"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,\\nyou might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse\\nthan I ever own.\"\\n\\nMary\\'s declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House,\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.\\nThey are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,\\nin general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\nbut Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\nBless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\nI otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\"  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\nI meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\nAnd on Mrs Musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for I know it would not do;\\nbut I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things\\nto rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\nI hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\nmy own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\nMrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\n\\nAgain, it was Mary\\'s complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\nat the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\nAnd one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\n\"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\nIt is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\nbut I know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\n\\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\nHer own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\nby being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary\\'s ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\nwas rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\nas she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\nExcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\nIn music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\nand Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\nfor her own.\\n\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\\nThe neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\nThere were more completely popular.\\n\\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\nwho depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\\n\"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nSo passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne\\'s heart\\nmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this\\nthe day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not\\nthink of it before.  How low it makes me!\"\\n\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\nto be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\n\"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked Charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\nAnne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\nShe wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned.  They came:  the master of the house\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\nthat Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nMrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\nShe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nHer manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\nAnne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\nof any sort.  She was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\nMrs Croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\\n\\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\nwhen Mrs Croft\\'s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\nthat Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,\\nand not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\npresent state with proper interest.\\n\\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\nshe heard the Admiral say to Mary--\\n\\n\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft\\'s here soon; I dare say\\nyou know him by name.\"\\n\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\nShe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\nwhen the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\nwas the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\nwhen Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\nI am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\nof poor Richard!  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\nthat her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\nthat Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\npoor Richard\\'s captain at one time; I do not know when or where,\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\nand of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\n\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\nby calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\nunfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\nCaptain Frederick Wentworth\\'s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\n\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\nof the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\\nMr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\n\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\nfrom Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne\\'s nerves.\\nShe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\nSince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick\\'s having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\n\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nA very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,\\nand Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\nand he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,\\nby the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment\\nto Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,\\nin Anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove\\'s civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\nShe and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child\\'s situation\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\n\\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\nIt was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nHer brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\nTill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\nthe information of Captain Wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\nmore full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\\n\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\nand Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\nto give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\nBut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\\nCharles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\nIt must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\nand Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\nThis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father\\nvery much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\n\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me\\nquite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.\\nYou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nMary knew, from Charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\nShe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\nbut as soon as there was only Anne to hear--\\n\\n\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\nI knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\nand Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\nTalks of his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\nI did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,\\nI am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all\\nequal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\\nof the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson\\'s directions,\\nand have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.\\nNursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\nA sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know\\nthat I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,\\nfor I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\nand you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think\\nCharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\nI am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.\\nI was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\\nto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,\\nI may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?\\nand it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\nare a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;\\nI am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,\\nindeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.\\nYou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\nis the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\nI should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child.\"\\n\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation, which began with Mary\\'s saying,\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\n\\n\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home\\nthan you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\nI should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\nAnne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\nIt is Anne\\'s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be\\na great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and I should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\nif Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\nagreeable to others?\\n\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\nPerhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\nHe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\n\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\nin Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\nin Mrs Charles Musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles\\'s being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\n\\nAnne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\n\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\nCharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;\\nhis sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\nand though Charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\n\\nMary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.\\nIn two minutes after Charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth\\'s,\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\nthe Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\nand Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\n\\n\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\\n\\nMary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.\\nThey had met.  They had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\nEight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\nHow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\\neight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part\\nof her own life.\\n\\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like\\nwishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\n\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\nfor, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was\\nso attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\nwhen they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\n\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\n\\n\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent,\\ndeep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\nlet him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\nShe had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.\\n\\n\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\nmake her happier.\\n\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\nHe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\nhad spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.\\nShe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\nconfident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.\\nIt had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been\\nweakness and timidity.\\n\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him\\nwas gone for ever.\\n\\nIt was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on shore,\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\nexcepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\nAnybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\nA little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\nand I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\n\\n\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior\\nI shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\\nI shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together\\nat Mr Musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\"\\n\"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\nAnne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\nThere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!\\nNow nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,\\nperhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\nNow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\nnever become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\nwhich reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\nof Mrs Musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,\\nI dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nAnne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\nshe found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.\\nI was the last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.\\nReported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off\\nto the West Indies.\"\\n\\nThe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nBut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,\\nyou would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\n\\n\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\nIt was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\na very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\nto be afloat again.\"\\n\\n\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\nAh! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.\\nI knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\nor that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate\\nI wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\nWe had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\npoor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation\\nnot having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,\\nand I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne\\'s shudderings\\nwere to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\n\\n\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there\\nhe met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\n\"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\nI always forgot.\"\\n\\n\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\nCharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\n\\n\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I\\nmade money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!\\nYou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.\\nExcellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,\\nso much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,\\nwhen I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget\\nwhat you did.\"\\n\\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\nof poor Richard.\"\\n\\n\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\nAh! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\nI assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\nwhich convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\n\\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.\\nIt was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\nand while the agitations of Anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\nA large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\\nwhich taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\n\\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\nnow came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\\nand her daughters.\"\\n\\n\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\nThere can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nThis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you. --All idle refinement!\\n--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.\\nI believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare\\nI have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\"\\n(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of\\nthe ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,\\nand three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that I could, and I would bring anything\\nof Harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine\\nthat I did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\\nand all her family to Plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\nWe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\nhe will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,\\nand a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married\\npeople begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,\\nwhen you are married.\\'  I can only say, `No, I shall not;\\' and then\\nthey say again, `Yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nHe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\\nto Mrs Croft.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\nthough many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic\\nfour times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\nCork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.  But I never went beyond the Streights,\\nand never was in the West Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,\\nyou know, the West Indies.\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\n\\n\"And I do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\nWhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\nand I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing\\nto be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered\\nin body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,\\nwhen the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.\\nI lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\nor when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\nnothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\\nMrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,\\nfor Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nThe evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,\\nAnne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\nof all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\nIf he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\nwho could wonder?\\n\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?\\nThe answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\nShe had rather play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too,\\nhe spoke to her.  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\nHis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe Admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  He had intended,\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\nof Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of Edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth\\namong the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth\\nvery much in the way.\\n\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth\\'s\\nintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\nonly two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money,\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,\\nbut it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove\\'s; and while\\nthe Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\nthe young Hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\nwith Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins.  Charles\\'s attentions to Henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;\\nbut from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne\\'s observation reached.\\nHenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\n\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different\\nat the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the Miss Musgroves\\' company, and Charles Hayter\\nhad but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\nCharles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\n\\nCharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\nhe had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\nHere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\nOh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should\\nrise to any very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!\\n`Lady Wentworth\\' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing,\\nindeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta\\nwould not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!\\nIt would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much\\nof your new creations.\"\\n\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;\\nand considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?\\nNothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove\\nof Uppercross.\"\\n\\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\n\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has\\na very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from\\nthe Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\npretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,\\nthat any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;\\nHenrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,\\nand Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\\nmarry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt\\nthat he has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.\\nI wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense\\nto say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.\\nBut Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you\\nwould have thought as I did, unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me.\"\\n\\nA dinner at Mr Musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\nof indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding\\nCaptain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nAs to Captain Wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\nthan that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.\\nEither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\ngood-humoured wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\\n\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\nwhen such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\nand obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.\\nThe advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\nof his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley\\'s\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,\\nbut had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:\\nshe was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\n\\n\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\\nI always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short,\\nyou know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nIs he coming, Louisa?\"\\n\\nOne morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,\\nat which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into\\nthe drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\nand could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:\\nMrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\nI dare say,\" had been Anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\nCaptain Wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nHe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\n\"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\\nthan Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.\\n\\nShe only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?\\nThe others will be here presently.\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\nthe newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nAnother minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nThere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\nbusy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.\\nShe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\nOnce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\n\\n\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome.\\nI am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\nDo not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to\\ncousin Charles.\"\\n\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir.\\n\\nIn another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\nbefore she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.\\n\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\nShe could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary\\nand the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\nand leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\\nthey were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\nIt was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his having said,\\nin a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth\\'s interference,\\n\"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\nand could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  But neither Charles Hayter\\'s feelings,\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\narranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\nfor while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.\\nThey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\nIt was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\nend in love with some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\nand yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\nAnne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\nShe did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\nany claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nAfter a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.\\nThree days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;\\na most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\nand having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nIt was Mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter\\nwas wise.\\n\\nOne morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the Mansion-house.\\n\\nIt was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\nMary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes,\\nI should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\"\\nAnne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\nthe Miss Musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\"\\nsaid Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing\\nthat I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\nif we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\nJust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\nTheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\n\\nAnne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\nShe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nIt was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\nmight fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.\\nLouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\nThis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\nof Louisa\\'s which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --\\n\\n\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.\\nI wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen\\nvery often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\\nas she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever\\nseparate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\nby anybody else.\"\\n\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\"\\nAnd there was silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\nblessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\ninto another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\"\\nBut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nWinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\nwhich parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nWinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nMary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\\nWell now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nHenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\nto do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\"\\ncried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly.\\n\\nCharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\nBut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\n\"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\n\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he\\nand Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\nto Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\nand saying to Captain Wentworth--\\n\\n\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,\\nI have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nShe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nThe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\nLouisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\nMary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\nwas sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  Anne found a nice seat\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\nMary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nAnne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\nCaptain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa\\'s voice was\\nthe first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech.  What Anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?\\nNo, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\\nmade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\nthe last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\nI see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,\\nyou have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\nYou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\nmay sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is a nut,\"\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not\\na weak spot anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\\n\"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\nIf Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nHe had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.\\nFor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\nWhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\nand they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, Louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\nand pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much\\nof the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.\\nI suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"When did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\\naccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nLady Russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  They think Charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,\\nand that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nThe sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\\nHer own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,\\nbefore she could move.  The listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character\\nwas considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation.\\n\\nAs soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\n\\nCharles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\nCharles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne\\ncould not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\nHenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\\nCharles Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\\n\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\nand least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles\\nand Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles\\'s other arm;\\nbut Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\nwith his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\nin being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\n\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft\\'s gig.\\nHe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\\nThe invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\n\"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room\\nfor three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might\\nsit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nAnne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral\\'s kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nYes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\nto give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\nThis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\nShe understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not\\nbe unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\nShe then found them talking of \"Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\\nsaid the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nAy, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have\\nsettled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;\\n\"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\nI had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always\\nbe company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;\\nI hardly know one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft,\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  One could not be\\nconnected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\n\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\nand Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\nand Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\nThis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\nat Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\nin leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.\\n\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\nCaptain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and\\nCaptain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.  They did not like each other,\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\nand she too little.\\n\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nThe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen\\nand unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\nA letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last,\\nhad brought intelligence of Captain Harville\\'s being settled\\nwith his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before, and Captain Wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\nand his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\n\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;\\nthough November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\nLouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,\\nLouisa, and Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\nbut to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\nthe middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\nfor going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  This was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove\\'s coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and Charles\\'s curricle, in which\\nhe drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nAfter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,\\nto make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,\\nCharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,\\nPinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\nIsle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\nto make the worth of Lyme understood.\\n\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.\\nCaptain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\nand he was to join them on the Cobb.\\n\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\nall well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,\\nand a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,\\non his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\nHe had been engaged to Captain Harville\\'s sister, and was now\\nmourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\npromotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.\\nShe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\nand sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,\\nthe friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\nand Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\nof Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick\\'s\\nstate of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick\\nwas very great.\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\nthan I have.  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\nHe is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\nyounger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nThey all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\nthan Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\na little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\nMrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\nbecause the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\nThe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\nof formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\n\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\nOn quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,\\nwere more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\nCaptain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\nCaptain Benwick.  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved.\\n\\nThey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\"\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\n\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in Captain Wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general.\\n\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne\\'s lot to be placed\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\nHe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\nand Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\nHe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion\\nor The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour\\nand The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\n\\nHis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\n\\nWhen the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nAnne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\nThey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\nbreeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\nthe sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,\\nlast spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\nNow, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely,\\nand fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?  Do not you agree with me,\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?\\nShe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\nmake it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\nin case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.\\nI really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation,\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\nMy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\nI must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\nDo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  And at Lyme too,\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\nShe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\nfelt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\n\"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate\\nwith Dr Shirley.  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  I always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\nbut I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat Uppercross.\"\\n\\nAnne was amused by Henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof Henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\non seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.\\nThey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\nbut Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\nThey were all at her disposal.\\n\\nWhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\nand stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;\\nand as they passed, Anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nShe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\nCaptain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you,\\nand even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\\n\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\nShe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\nBoth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\nIt was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\n\\nThey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party\\nto the window.  It was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\nsomebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne\\'s curiosity,\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\nfrom Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\nat dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath\\nand London.\"\\n\\n\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,\\nit must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see,\\njust as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!\\nIn the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the Kellynch family?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!\\nHeir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,\\nif it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive\\nhow extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\nWhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\nDo you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,\\nI was looking at the horses; but I think he had something\\nof the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!\\nOh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\nso it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\nsaid Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nWhen she could command Mary\\'s attention, Anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\nShe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\nthe second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\nquite ill-used by Anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,\\nthe next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nAnne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given\\nher father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\nshe suspected; and that Mr Elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\\nfell on Anne.\\n\\nBreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain\\nand Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off\\nfor Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\nsome time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\nCaptain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible;\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\nand you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\\n\\n\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\\njust made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\nhe sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.\\nThere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.\\nI would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia\\nhad come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest;\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\ntravelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off\\nto the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\nThat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\\nYou may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nMrs Harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\nBy all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\nnear the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\nall were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the Cobb.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron\\'s\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\nhe did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\nHe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined\\nI will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\nshe fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\nThere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around!\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\n\"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\nand in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain\\nBenwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\n\\n\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\nburst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\nall his own strength were gone.\\n\\n\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\nI can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\nand Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\nand everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;\\nwhile Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\\n\\nHe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\nwhen Anne eagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?\\nHe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nAs to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\nCaptain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate\\nbrother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give.\\n\\nAnne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\nwhich instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,\\nto assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?\\nWhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\\nMusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people\\nHenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,\\nand Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\n\\nThey were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.\\nCaptain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\nShocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\nThey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\nbeneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville\\'s direction,\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them.\\n\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\nMary, too, was growing calmer.\\n\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\nThey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\nThe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,\\nmay be conceived.\\n\\nThe tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered\\nby Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them.\\n\\nLouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\nas to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,\\ndid not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The Harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\nThey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\nThey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville\\'s care entirely.\\nMrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\nwas just such another.  Between these two, she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\n\\nCharles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\n\"Uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to Uppercross;\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\nAt first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\nEvery minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off\\nfor Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\\n\\nCharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\nHe would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\nSo far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.\\nShe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness\\nof her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa\\'s room,\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\nShe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\n\\nThe plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly\\ndown from Louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\n\\n\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,\\n\"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.\\nBut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,\\nI think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,\\nwish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,\\nso capable as Anne.\"\\n\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\nand she then appeared.\\n\\n\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply,\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor\\nin Louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville\\nwould but think so.\"\\n\\nOne thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable\\nthat Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\nand Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\nand leave Mr Musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of Louisa\\'s night.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was\\nmade known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\nShe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was\\nnothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\nto stay in Henrietta\\'s stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?\\nAnd to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!\\nNo, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne\\nwas inevitable.\\n\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\nfor the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick\\nattending to her.  She gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta\\'s schemes\\nfor Dr Shirley\\'s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had\\nfirst seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,\\nmade but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.\\n\\nShe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating\\nthe feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have\\nattended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nIn the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.\\nHow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\nIt was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only,\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\nwalk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!\\nBut so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\\n\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\nand limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character.\\n\\nThey got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\nAnne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn a low, cautious voice, he said: --\\n\\n\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not\\nappear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in\\nand break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nShe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\n\\n(End of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of Anne\\'s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\nwas spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\nin Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\nbeen difficulties.\\n\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was\\nmuch the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\nCharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\nmore particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\nespecially of Mrs Harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"She really left\\nnothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night.  Mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\nWhen he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\nthat Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\nIt would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,\\nand Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of\\ngetting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;\\nbut without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\nand found practicable so soon.\\n\\nThey were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all\\nthe minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,\\nand his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in Lyme.\\n\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters\\nfor one another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.\\nShe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.\\nThey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\nthey might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\n\\nShe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross\\nits cheerful character.  A few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nIf Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than\\nformer happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt,\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\nA few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\nall that was most unlike Anne Elliot!\\n\\nAn hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\non a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\nto make the sound of Lady Russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House,\\nor look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\nScenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.\\nIt stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\nShe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been.\\n\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell\\'s house\\nin September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress.\\n\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,\\neither Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell\\nfancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\n\\nWhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\nThe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\namong the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;\\nand when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still\\nbe with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,\\nthan her own father\\'s house in Camden Place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\nwith Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.\\nLady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\nlament the result, and Captain Wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\nAnne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.\\nShe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\nLady Russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.\\nWhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\n\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\nbe charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.\\n\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,\\nwhich found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\na rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,\\nLady Russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\n\"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.\\nAnne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\nIt will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nAnne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\nin observing--\\n\\n\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\nBy remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nShe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  These convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\nthat pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,\\n\"These rooms ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen\\nin their destination!  How unworthily occupied!  An ancient family\\nto be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\"\\nNo, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave.\\n\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\nthat Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time\\nsince the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot\\'s not being\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\nThis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done.\\n\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\nhow long Miss Musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\nThe Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\nis not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\ntruly!\"\\n\\nAdmiral Croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,\\nbut they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\\nrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.\\nBut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself),\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\nin the butler\\'s room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.\\nOne man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\nAnd so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\n\\nAnne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral,\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,\\nat Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.\\nThe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter\\nwhat we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.\\nI have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\nA very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:\\nbut I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\n\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\nSuch a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away\\nfrom one\\'s self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\nshifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\nthat I never go near.\"\\n\\nAnne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,\\npray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft\\'s, and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\nI grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,\\nwith my compliments.  He will be glad to hear it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.\\n\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe enough,\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove\\'s going than Anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\nand as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross\\nthey drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nThey had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had\\ngot Mrs Harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\nsupply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable.\\n\\nMary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\nCharles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\nthey dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\nand at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\nCharles laughed.\\n\\n\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is\\na very odd young man.  I do not know what he would be at.\\nWe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\nI thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had\\n`been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.\\nI suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\nI should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage\\nfor such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\nCharles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well\\nhow it really was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.)\\n\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered\\nthat Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\nand he had not courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour,\\nMary knows it is.\"\\n\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\nnot considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\nAnne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be\\nleft to be guessed.  Anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard.  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\nand continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\"\\nMary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him\\nmention Anne twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne,\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\nHis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,\\nbut it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta\\nall about it; and then `Miss Elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\nNow Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were\\nin the other room.  `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' Oh! there was no end\\nof Miss Elliot\\'s charms.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\nif he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart\\nis very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling.\\n\\n\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\nhe will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,\\nyou may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,\\nand I told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\nand I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\nSo, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\\n\\n\"Any acquaintance of Anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\nwas Lady Russell\\'s kind answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! as to being Anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy\\nto see Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma\\'am.\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\nHe is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him.\"\\n\\n\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like him.\\nI think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\\nHe is just Lady Russell\\'s sort.  Give him a book, and he will\\nread all day long.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think\\nLady Russell would like that?\"\\n\\nLady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she,\\n\"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\nas I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\nI wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.\\n\\n\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.\\nHis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nThis decision checked Mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the Elliot countenance.\\n\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going\\ndown to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\\nto go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.\\nLady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\nCaptain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it\\nthan Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\na week\\'s indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\n\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\nbringing with them Mrs Harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\nof Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\n\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,\\nwhen Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nThough neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,\\nnor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\nof the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,\\nduring their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nAnne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\nwhich Louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,\\nwho got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home.\\n\\nLouisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\\n\\n\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross\\nin the Christmas holidays.\"\\n\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\nrather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,\\nwas entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\nunder their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\n\\nAnne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\nof Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\nMr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful\\nif it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\nno wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\nbut she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.\\n\\nShe was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\nand both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I\\nleave you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\nand met her with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\n\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination\\nto listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\nall their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:\\nit was all Bath.\\n\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\nor the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after.  Everybody was wanting to visit them.\\nThey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nHere were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\nwho had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\nThey had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.\\nHe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\nHe had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath\\nin November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of\\nSir Walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\nin Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\nwas completely re-established.\\n\\nThey had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted\\nof being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\nHe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\n\\nThe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\nSir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough\\nBuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it.\\n\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\nShe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\nThere had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,\\nnot all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\nHere was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in Camden Place.\\n\\nAnne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nShe heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\nin Mr Elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\nto be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\nIn all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\nand the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\nA sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;\\nit was, perhaps, for Elizabeth\\'s sake.  There might really have been\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,\\nand when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth\\nwere his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\nand that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot\\'s frequent visits\\nwere talked of.\\n\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\\nThey did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\\nto her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;\\nSir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think\\nthat he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean\\nto complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of\\nthe whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\nand there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\nin Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\nSir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.\\nHe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  The worst of Bath was\\nthe number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\nHe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\nas he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\na tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!\\nthey were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\nHe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\nupon Colonel Wallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed\\nto escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\\nthat Colonel Wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\nas Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.\\n\"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not\\nhappen every day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\nand grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!\\nIt was ten o\\'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine\\nin Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.\\nMrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot\\'s knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.\\nWith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\nMr Elliot was ushered into the room.\\n\\nIt was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nAnne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\nmust follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\n\"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\n(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking\\nas he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  They were not the same,\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\n\\nHe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,\\nhe began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\nShe gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.\\nHis regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\nIf he had but asked who the party were!  The name of Musgrove would\\nhave told him enough.  \"Well, it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\nare more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world.  The folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.\\n\\nHis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\nHaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\nWhen he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\nShe could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\n\\nHe staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-\\npiece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\nbefore Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\nCamden Place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nThere was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot\\'s\\nbeing in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\nin love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay\\nto have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\n\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.\\nShe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say, \"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet,\\nyou have seen nothing of Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.\\nYou must not run away from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted\\nwith Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,\\nI well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised\\nto see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.\\nHer countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\nand promise to stay.\\n\\nIn the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\"\\nhe supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\nyou cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,\\nthe constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\nYou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must\\ntake its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\nif Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always\\ncommand a home with Lady Russell.\\n\\nLady Russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay\\nin such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\nas she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\"\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\nHe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\nHe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\nShe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis\\nsaid it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\\n\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\nIn Lady Russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\nand at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;\\ntime will explain.\"\\n\\nIt was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,\\nfelt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.\\nIn that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\nA little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,\\nAnne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nHowever it might end, he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\nas herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\n\\nThey did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance,\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\nand her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort\\nof No.--, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples\\n(in Anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\n\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\nall day long.\\n\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter\\'s\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.\\nNo letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\nHow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\nin a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\nthought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth preserving,\\ngood company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,\\nfor three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.\\nShe had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\nto his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.\\n\"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\nThe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  They visited\\nin Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\\nand the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible:  and \"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin,\\nLady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nAnne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\\nbut for her birth.\\n\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\nthey had their value.  Anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\nthat is what I call good company.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\nthat is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\nBirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\nit will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.\\nShe is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin\"\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\\nWill it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,\\nthat they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride\\nthan any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\nIn London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\nit might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\nBut here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.\\nYou talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\nwould have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\na little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\n\"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nHe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\nand though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description.\\n\\nShe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\nof there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\\nnow Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nMiss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\nthat Anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nShe was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\n\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore\\nlost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\nor what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.\\nShe only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith\\'s lodgings\\nin Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nThe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\n\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\nand Anne\\'s astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith\\'s.  She had been\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\nHer accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\nYet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\nIt was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\n\\nThere had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,\\ncompared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\nShe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\n\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\nShe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\nShe always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody\\'s heart is open,\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,\\nsensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\n`the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\nCall it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour\\'s\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\nknow one\\'s species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\nTo me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nAnne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\n\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\nSuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\nAnd it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\nthough I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\nHere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\nThere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\nIt was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\n\\n\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.\\nShe has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all\\nthe high-priced things I have in hand now.\"\\n\\nAnne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\nof such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning\\nfrom Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\nin Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.\\nThey were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth\\nwas disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot\\nto be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;\\nand who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?\\nThat she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary,\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when I have\\ncalled on Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.\\n\"Sir Henry Russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\\nA poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\na mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\\n\\nMrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it\\nto himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\\nin Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\nand no surname of dignity.\\n\\nAnne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\nShe had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;\\nand Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,\\nand Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\nHer kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.\\nHe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell\\nin a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\n\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\nShe would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  Anne heard her,\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\nand gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell,\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\nI think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\nA most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\nI think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nLady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,\\nthe future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother\\'s self\\nin countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\nMy dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life!\"\\n\\nAnne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\nof having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself;\\nof being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\nLady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\nwhat Anne did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch\\nand of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.\\nAnd it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against Mr Elliot.\\n\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\nclear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,\\nif not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\nShe saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\nHow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\n\\nMr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\nThere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.\\nHer early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\nWarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,\\nstood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see\\nwhat Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\nMrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\n\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of\\nthe following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nIt was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,\\nwas growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.\\nShe wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.\\nIt was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew\\nthat Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be\\nrecovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft\\'s compliments.\\n\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.\\nThey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an introduction.\\nI should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.\\nI know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nAnne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\nthe poor Admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\nIt had been begun several days back.\\n\\n\\n            \"February 1st.\\n\\n\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.\\nYou must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had\\na very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.\\nThe holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,\\nexcept of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\nWhat dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\nI have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,\\nexcept Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\nBetween ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\\nas long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\nThe carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.\\nWe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\nMrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\nI am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted\\nwith him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\nto be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\\nwith Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\nLet me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children\\nto be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well,\\nfor a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\\nare going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.\\nCharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\nI do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\\n\\n  \"Mary M---.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\nvery much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa\\nbore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal\\nto add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,\\nand I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.\\nI shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.\\nI have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\nShe and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\nas well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\nNeither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,\\nand not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.\\nTrue, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.\\nMrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\nWe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;\\nand Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick\\nis expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\\nwill say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;\\nI never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,\\nof Captain Benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\nHow Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.\\nCertainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the Hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nMary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\nof the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter\\nwanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\\nas it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\n\"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\\n\\n\"They come on the Admiral\\'s account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft\\'s\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft\\nwill be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.\\nElizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\nWe had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.\\nThere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\nI am told, are sailors.  The Crofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\nin an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\nAnne was at liberty.\\n\\nIn her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,\\njoyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\nfeeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!\\nWhere could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.\\nIt had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta\\'s\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\nand Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\nand Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary\\nmight have allowed.  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.\\nHe must love somebody.\\n\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\nHe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of\\nLouisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\nof its being so.  The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate.\\n\\nThe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof Captain Wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\nand if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\nto be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne\\'s heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.\\nShe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\nThey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\n\\nShe longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\nThe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove\\nwas mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,\\nperfectly to Sir Walter\\'s satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,\\nand considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\nThey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\nHe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.\\nLady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\nKnowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\nto see the Admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the Croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\nand return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.\\nThis is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,\\nstaring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping.\\nBut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\\nDid you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\nwhich they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\"\\n(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\nWell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere\\nfor you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you\\nas we go along.  There, take my arm; that\\'s right; I do not\\nfeel comfortable if I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\"\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;\\nI shall only say, `How d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.\\n`How d\\'ye do?\\'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nShe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her heels,\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the street,\\nyou will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby fellows,\\nboth of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nSophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:\\ngot away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story\\nanother time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.\\nLook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\nAh! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!\\nHow do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.\\nWe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\nand draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch,\\nay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.\\nWe do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.\\nThe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\n\\nWhen they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\nfor the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was\\nnot really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.\\nAs soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\nBut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\nI am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have\\nall been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been\\nhappening to.  Her Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\\n\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\\nif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,\\nthis Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.\\nHe was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right.  But even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on.  Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,\\nand then he went off to see Edward.  When we came back from Minehead\\nhe was gone down to Edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\nWe have seen nothing of him since November.  Even Sophy could\\nnot understand it.  But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;\\nfor this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being\\nto marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne,\\n\"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\\nHe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.\\nAn excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom Captain Benwick\\'s manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,\\nand I will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nAnne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\nnot at all to represent Captain Benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\nshe was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.\\nWe have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\nin a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.\\nI fancy they are all at Uppercross.\"\\n\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\n\"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain\\nWentworth\\'s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.\\nIt did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\nand Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\n\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\ntoo much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\"\\n\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,\\nand beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.\\nIt would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other\\nMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\nDo not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing\\nhis wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were\\nin Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in Lady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,\\nturned into Molland\\'s, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,\\nto request her assistance.  He soon joined them again, successful,\\nof course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nHer ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt\\nas to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also\\na mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne\\'s;\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\\nhad a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,\\nthat his cousin Anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\n\\nIt was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\nCaptain Wentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\nand absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\nit was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\nand Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street\\non a commission of Mrs Clay\\'s.\\n\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.\\nShe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.\\nShe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\nCaptain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\na little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\nhe looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\nShe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\nAll the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,\\nshe had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\na something between delight and misery.\\n\\nHe spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nAfter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\nTime had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness\\nof some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\\nof the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\nCaptain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nIt did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\n\\nLady Dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\nIt was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\\nMiss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\nand Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them.\\nThe carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer walking.\"\\n\\n\"But it rains.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday,\\nI have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\"\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,\\nif you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\n\\nShe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\nand adding, \"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.\\nCaptain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,\\nadmiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"Good morning to you!\"\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\n\\nAs soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth\\'s party\\nbegan talking of them.\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.\\nHe is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.\\nWhat a very good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\nto look at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess\\nI admire her more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! so do I.\"\\n\\n\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.\\nAnne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.\\nShe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,\\nand insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now\\nshe could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\n\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\nhe meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?\\n\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter\\nLady Russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\nin returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\nShe looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was\\nnot to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nLady Russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\\nof her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell\\'s mind,\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\nof one personal grace!\\n\\nAt last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she\\nspeak of him?\"\\n\\n\"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\nbut I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and\\nMrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\nand I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess\\nI can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\neither at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\nA day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\nfor the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\nIt was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.\\nOf course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,\\nand Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\\nLady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\nMrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nWho is your party?\"\\n\\nAnne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\n\"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\nto-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding\\nthat I may not have many more visits from you.\"\\n\\nAnne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nSir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door\\nopened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\nHe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\"\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\nTheir being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\nand on Captain Wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\\nThis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nAfter talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time.\"\\n\\nShe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\n\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\nWhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be\\na very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think,\\nends the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\nThe Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\nAll this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nHe stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne\\'s cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,\\nhe proceeded thus--\\n\\n\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\nbut Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;\\nand I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\nit would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\\nIt seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\nFanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\nEither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\nso far as to say--\\n\\n\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\\n\\n\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa\\'s doing well\\nwas quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.\\nShe would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.\\nThe country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;\\nand the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\\n\\n\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\nI should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne;\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\nOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\nby no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\nat Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nAs she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot\\nand Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was\\na group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.\\nShe was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\nShe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\ntowards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\nShe was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\nas being less happy than herself.\\n\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw\\nthat he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\na moment\\'s regret.  But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her,\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\n\\nUpon Lady Russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\nand proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\n\\nVery, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be\\nan insult to the nature of Anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\n\\nAnne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\nHer happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\na hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\nin only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\nat Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  Yes, some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less.  He must love her.\\n\\nThese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on,\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\nAnne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\nMiss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof Colonel Wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nAnne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\nat least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,\\nin the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained\\nthe words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\nfor certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend\\nto understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.\\nYou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;\\nand I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since\\nI came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family.\"\\n\\n\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\nNo one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\nis irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,\\nbut he would not tell.\\n\\n\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\nHe had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot\\'s company,\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\nVery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,\\nI would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nSuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\nHer father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air\\nthan one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;\\nCaptain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant\\nin Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\\n\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne\\'s eyes had caught\\nthe right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.\\nIt seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\n\\nWhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nMr Elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\\n\\nThe first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nHe did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again,\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\nTo Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\nShe could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nIn re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\nwas favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,\\nand Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\nand a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,\\nwithout comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed.\\n\\nSuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth\\nwas again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something\\nmust be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\\nwas strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,\\nof Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\nHe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain\\nWentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\nAnne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.\\nIt came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\nto explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\nA few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night;\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.\\nCaptain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it\\na week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nBut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\nHow was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?\\nHow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think\\nof Mr Elliot\\'s attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\nMr Elliot was almost a first object.\\n\\nShe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\nperhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.\\nHow she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\nher affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nPrettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\ncould never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne\\nwas sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.\\nIt was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\n\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne\\'s recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\\nwas well know by name to Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\nThey never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\\nin the room.\"\\n\\n\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\nwith the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,\\nI know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;\\nfor as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\nfor hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen\\nvery little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.\\nThere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\nand this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\n\\n\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nAnne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\nA blush overspread Anne\\'s cheeks.  She could say nothing.\\n\\n\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,\\n\"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time.\"\\n\\nAnne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\nhow any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.\\nAfter another short silence--\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\nDoes he know that I am in Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment\\'s reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\nmore composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.\\nHad I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.\\nI want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.\\nHe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\nof course it is done.\"\\n\\n\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\nI am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\nYou must consider me only as Mr Elliot\\'s relation.  If in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\nI beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.\\nI ought to have waited for official information,  But now, my dear\\nMiss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\\nNext week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\nMr Elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\nI assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.\\nI should like to know why you imagine I am?\"\\n\\nMrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew\\nwhat you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?\\nLet me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for\\nmy former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?\\nWhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\nLet me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly,\\n\"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\nDo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  Let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\nNinety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,\\nI hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,\\nand safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\nHe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.\\nI have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\nto do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\nI think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner\\nof speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\nSurely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\nShould he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you\\nI shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\\n\\nShe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed\\nno one in particular.\"\\n\\n\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in.  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday;\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.\\nShe had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\nShe sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\n\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make\\na very long history, I think, of one such little article\\nof unfounded news.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?\\nShall I take any message?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,\\nand under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,\\nI have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"I did.\"\\n\\n\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Intimately.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\nI have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.\\nWas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nThey were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers\\nI have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.\\nI have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.\\nThere were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\nEven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;\\nI think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith Mr Elliot\\'s real character.  Though I fully believe that,\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,\\nbe differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.\\nThose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\nHe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\nOh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nAnne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\nBut I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.\\nI will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.\\nHe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\nand thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,\\nbecame excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not\\nthink very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\nalways together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.\\nHe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\nhe had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\nMy poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse\\nwas open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot\\'s life,\"\\nsaid Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\nIt must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\nwhich I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\n\\n\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,\\nbut I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited\\nand encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\nI knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\nI was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\nI did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\nI have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.\\nHe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\nand I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\nI cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\nThat was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.\\nHe told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.\\nIt was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\nand that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\nspoke of me to Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nShe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\"\\ncried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.\\nI could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;\\nI have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\\nThe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\nto his character.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\\nWhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young,\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.\\nI think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what Mr Elliot was doing.  `To do the best for himself,\\'\\npassed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,\\nwas all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\nthrown by chance into Mr Elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\nwith respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\nDepend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\nHis chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\nbut I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\\non that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\nThis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\nI am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\n\\n\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;\\nstay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nAnne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\nThe box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\na small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.\\nThe letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\nBut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\nand when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\nHere it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad\\nthat I can produce it.\"\\n\\nThis was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\\nand dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --\\n\\n\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.\\nI wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\nAt present, believe me, I have no need of your services,\\nbeing in cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.\\nThey are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\nThe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\nhe is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse\\nthan last year.\\n\\n\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of Walter\\nI can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\nto be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\\n\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;\\nand Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\\nthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nBut it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\\nCan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\nyou were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"Can you really?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\nand I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,\\nbut I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.\\nHe truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:\\nhis friend Colonel Wallis.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\\nof his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\nbut Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\nShe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend\\nMrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.\\nWhen I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.\\nMr Elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\nThat was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when I arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\nNobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you\\nindeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without\\nknowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?\\nDid he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\'\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\n\\n\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.\\nI happened to be at Lyme.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\\nat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,\\nand from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive\\nin his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,\\nwhich I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\nwhom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\\nas long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter\\'s acquaintance,\\nof her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise\\nthat Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,\\nand she continued--\\n\\n\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\nvisit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,\\nthat time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot\\'s opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\nHe cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\nof coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\nMr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\nadded another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.\\nHe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\ncalled at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.\\nYou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\nI know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.\\nI have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\nI should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.\\nA scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\nbut my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `Why, to be sure,\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,\\nis a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter\\'s making a second match.\\nShe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through\\nMrs Wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.\\nMy line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\n\\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\nand Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\nMrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\nFrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\nThey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot\\'s regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\nurgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\nAnne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\nusual state of mind.\\n\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.\\nMr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\nShe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\nThis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\nwas hard to bear.\\n\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne\\'s good offices\\nwith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\nsince he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne\\'s feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliot\\'s character would allow,\\nwhen Anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at Mrs Smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him!\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\nI considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,\\nthan if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,\\nas I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\nHe was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.\\nBut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\nI was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\n\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\nwas, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.\\nThere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as\\nopposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\nPity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.\\nIn every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.\\nShe must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\n\\n\\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\nescaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\nso Mrs Clay says, at least.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  However, when I found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly.\\nMr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,\\nto turn her eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!\\nDear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  If you will have such\\nideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\nI did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.\\nWhen I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\\nthe sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise.\\n\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\nShe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\n\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable.\\n\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\\nhis return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.\\nIt was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\nIt was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay\\'s selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot\\'s\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\nShe saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.\\nOh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\nand pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\nYou need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.\\nI used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her\\nat the concert.  Something so formal and arrange in her air!\\nand she sits so upright!  My best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,\\nthat I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;\\nbut I shall only leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\nIf she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\nbut last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?\\nAnne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\nAfter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\nand \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\n\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\nbut Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\nThey were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were\\nat the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;\\nbut till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\nAnne could not draw upon Charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,\\nand Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by Captain Harville\\'s wanting to\\ncome to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed\\ncoming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had\\nsome old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\na good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.\\nMrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\\n\\nAnne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor Henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,\\nvery recently, (since Mary\\'s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\nquite as soon as Louisa\\'s.  \"And a very good living it was,\"\\nCharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.\\nIn the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get\\na special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\nhe observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That\\'s the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\nI hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should have\\ndaughters\\' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta\\'s match.\\nShe never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,\\nnor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;\\nand I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  They do everything\\nto confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\n\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\nand Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\nall day long.\"\\n\\nAnne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste,\\nI know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think\\nI am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.\\nWe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\nthat I have liked him the better ever since.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles\\'s\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs.\\n\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\nas they were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister,\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nElizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\nShe felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.\\nIt was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\nand then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:\\n\"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\nto give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\nand I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;\\nput her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  I will ask them all for an evening;\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\nThey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted\\nto come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,\\nbut most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\nMary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked\\nto meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;\\nand Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her\\nand Henrietta directly.\\n\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;\\nbut Anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\nand Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\nand on Charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove\\'s\\nhistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have\\nher moments of imagining.\\n\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with\\nCaptains Harville and Wentworth.  The appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  It was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\nTheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.\\nHe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\\n\"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  And yet,\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind.\\n\\n\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay,\\nI am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\nI saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed\\ndeep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.\\nIt is Mr Elliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.\\nHe was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nMary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne\\nto come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late\\nif you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.\\nHe is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have\\nforgot all about Lyme.\"\\n\\nTo pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\nAnne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,\\ncertainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,\\nor I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\n\\nThe visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.\\nI have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\nA\\'n\\'t I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nIt holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.\\nHave not I done well, mother?\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\nTake a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\nHow can you be so forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\nNever worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,\\nI think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,\\nbut I shall go to the play.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\n\\n\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n`happy.\\'  There was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.\\nWe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.\\nNothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\nWe are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention\\nis due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.\\n\"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,\\nI should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\nWhat is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,\\nwho saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.\\n\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back\\nand change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,\\nand we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on Mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\nI have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\n\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;\\nCharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\\n\\n\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.\\nI am no card-player.\"\\n\\n\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\n\"It is a period, indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne\\'s imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\nshould come in.\\n\\nThey were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\nwherewith to pity her.\\n\\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\nfor Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\nHow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nShe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nElizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\\nexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.\\n\"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\nIt was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,\\nthat Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\nThe past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,\\nand Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\nbut not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\nShe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"Only think of Elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered Mary\\nvery audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!\\nYou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nAnne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nThe party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\nAnne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose.\\n\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\nquestion, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\n\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in Mrs Clay\\'s face as she listened.  It was transient:\\ncleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature: --\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise\\nI met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.\\nHe turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\\nsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;\\nfor I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\nHe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\nHe was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that I have been\\nfull of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nOne day only had passed since Anne\\'s conversation with Mrs Smith;\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\nby Mr Elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be\\nwith the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,\\nand Mr Elliot\\'s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade\\'s head,\\nmust live another day.\\n\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart,\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\nThe party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,\\nand Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard\\nthat Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,\\nno waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after\\nher entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\n\\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\nAnne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\nas Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\n\"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,\\nand what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\nto my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\nI said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\nit was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"And so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\nfor Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\nAt any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft.\\n\"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against\\nfor my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\nan engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\nI hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\nCaptain Wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\nbut Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\nher mind was in confusion.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him,\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\n\"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself\\nand went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  As she joined him,\\nCaptain Harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)\\n\"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our\\nwalking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--\\nbut no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with\\na clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\nand I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\nIt was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?\\nI hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\nover to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\nCaptain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\n\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\nIt is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.\\nWe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\nYou are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply\\nto Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall\\nwe say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  I will not allow it to be more\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\nor have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\nMan is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nNay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\nYou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\nYou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nYour home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\"\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\nadded to all this.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\nto Captain Wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\nIt was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught.\\n\\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\\n\\n\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.\\nI am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,\\nand want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,\\nI suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.\\nBut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\nprose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think\\nI ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all\\nwritten by men.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\nin books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\nbeen in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nWe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\n\"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\nand then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\nAnd then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\nand saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\nas if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\nIf I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\nI speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\nwith emotion.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,\\nand by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\nI should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\nso long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\nan object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\nAll the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.\\nAnd when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\nTheir attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.\\n\\n\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.\\n\"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\nTo-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\n(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\nand I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;\\nand you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I\\nshall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,\\nI am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.\\nI shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\n\\nMrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how\\nto understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\"\\nfrom Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\nHe had passed out of the room without a look!\\n\\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\nplaced it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\nalmost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\nthe work of an instant!\\n\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost\\nbeyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\nto \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,\\nhe had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\n\\n\\n\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,\\nhalf hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\nand a half ago.  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.\\nUnjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,\\nbut never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.\\nFor you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?\\nCan you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even\\nthese ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have\\npenetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\nToo good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.\\nYou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\nBelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\\n\\n\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,\\nwill be enough to decide whether I enter your father\\'s house\\nthis evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half and hour\\'s solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.\\nAnd before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\nCharles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\\n\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\nShe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\nstir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\nshe said she would go home.\\n\\n\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\nI wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.\\nCharles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\\n\\nBut the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\ncould not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\nin the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\nfinding her better at night.\\n\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"I am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\nPray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\\nand Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.\\nCaptain Harville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\\nWill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\nYou will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville\\nanywhere, remember to give Miss Anne\\'s message.  But indeed, my dear,\\nyou need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,\\nI\\'ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\"\\n\\nAnne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,\\nhowever.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby Captain Harville.  Another momentary vexation occurred.\\nCharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\nthere was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\n\\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\nof Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\nAnne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\nand not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.\\nPresently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,\\nor farther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\\nBecause, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\nShe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\nand I ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the Market Place.\\nHe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\nthat I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.\\nBy his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\nwhich you shot with one day round Winthrop.\"\\n\\nThere could not be an objection.  There could be only the most\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\nIn half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\nand estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nShe had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\n\\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.\\nHe never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\nto be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\na sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at\\nCaptain Harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\n\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\nfor Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which Louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\nThere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\n\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof Louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,\\nI could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\nperhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour\\nif she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously\\non this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had\\nno right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls,\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\nill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\nif her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.\\nIt determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\nHe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\nI could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith Benwick.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;\\nI could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first\\nfive minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,\\' and I was.\\nWas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope?  You were single.  It was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help\\noften saying, `Was this for me?\\'\"\\n\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,\\nbut the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward\\nin the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot\\'s appearing\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\nwith energy.\\n\\n\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on\\nwithout agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\\nwas it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\nWhen I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\nin aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\\nof your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\nI had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit\\nwas to be added.\"\\n\\n\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,\\nI was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,\\nand I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nAt last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\nAn interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment.\\n\\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\nIt was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found\\nan evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\nMr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\nShe cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\nand with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;\\nand I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,\\nthat I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place\\nof a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\nand for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right\\nin submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,\\nbecause I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now,\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\\nto reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\nI trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned\\nto England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\nand was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,\\nwould you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\nbut I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.\\nI shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\nThis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\nI have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\nwith a smile. \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\nI must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and\\nan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\nSir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\n\\nSir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,\\nwhen he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour.\\n\\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\nand do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what\\nLady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth\\'s manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\nMr Elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less\\nfor Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes.\\n\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\nin others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nOf all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\nit was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\nAnne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.\\n\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\nShe had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nThe news of his cousins Anne\\'s engagement burst on Mr Elliot\\nmost unexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\nhis best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  But, though discomfited\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay\\'s\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in London, it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nMrs Clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of Sir William.\\n\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\n\\nAnne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell\\'s meaning\\nto love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity.  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\nLady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself.  Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\nhe could now value from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\nand as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently.\\n\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\nsecured her two.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\nand Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husband\\'s property in the West Indies, by writing for her,\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\n\\nMrs Smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\nShe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\nand yet be happy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits, as her friend Anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\nAnne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\nin Captain Wentworth\\'s affection.  His profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n        Finis\\n\\n\\n\\n[Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811]\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\n\\nThe family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.\\nTheir estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,\\nin the centre of their property, where, for many generations,\\nthey had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage\\nthe general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.\\nThe late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived\\nto a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,\\nhad a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.\\nBut her death, which happened ten years before his own,\\nproduced a great alteration in his home; for to supply\\nher loss, he invited and received into his house the family\\nof his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor\\nof the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended\\nto bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece,\\nand their children, the old Gentleman\\'s days were\\ncomfortably spent.  His attachment to them all increased.\\nThe constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood\\nto his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,\\nbut from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness\\nof the children added a relish to his existence.\\n\\nBy a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one\\nson: by his present lady, three daughters.  The son,\\na steady respectable young man, was amply provided\\nfor by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.\\nBy his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,\\nhe added to his wealth.  To him therefore the succession\\nto the Norland estate was not so really important as to\\nhis sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might\\narise to them from their father\\'s inheriting that property,\\ncould be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;\\nfor the remaining moiety of his first wife\\'s fortune was\\nalso secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest\\nin it.\\n\\nThe old gentleman died: his will was read, and\\nlike almost every other will, gave as much disappointment\\nas pleasure.  He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,\\nas to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him\\non such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.\\nMr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\\nwife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to\\nhis son, and his son\\'s son, a child of four years old,\\nit was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself\\nno power of providing for those who were most dear\\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge\\non the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.\\nThe whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,\\nin occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,\\nhad so far gained on the affections of his uncle,\\nby such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\nof two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,\\nan earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,\\nand a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value\\nof all the attention which, for years, he had received\\nfrom his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to\\nbe unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection\\nfor the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s disappointment was, at first, severe;\\nbut his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might\\nreasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,\\nlay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate\\nalready large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.\\nBut the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his\\nonly one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer;\\nand ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,\\nwas all that remained for his widow and daughters.\\n\\nHis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,\\nand to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength\\nand urgency which illness could command, the interest\\nof his mother-in-law and sisters.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the\\nrest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation\\nof such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do\\nevery thing in his power to make them comfortable.\\nHis father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\nand Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how\\nmuch there might prudently be in his power to do for them.\\n\\nHe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to\\nbe rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be\\nill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;\\nfor he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge\\nof his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman,\\nhe might have been made still more respectable than he\\nwas:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he\\nwas very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.\\nBut Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--\\nmore narrow-minded and selfish.\\n\\nWhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated\\nwithin himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters\\nby the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.  He then\\nreally thought himself equal to it.  The prospect of four\\nthousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother\\'s fortune,\\nwarmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--\\n\"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would\\nbe liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make\\nthem completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he could\\nspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--\\nHe thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,\\nand he did not repent.\\n\\nNo sooner was his father\\'s funeral over, than Mrs. John\\nDashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her\\nmother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.\\nNo one could dispute her right to come; the house was\\nher husband\\'s from the moment of his father\\'s decease;\\nbut the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,\\nand to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s situation, with only\\ncommon feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--\\nbut in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,\\na generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,\\nby whomsoever given or received, was to her a source\\nof immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never\\nbeen a favourite with any of her husband\\'s family;\\nbut she had had no opportunity, till the present,\\nof shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\\nof other people she could act when occasion required it.\\n\\nSo acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious\\nbehaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her\\ndaughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,\\nshe would have quitted the house for ever, had not the\\nentreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect\\non the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all\\nher three children determined her afterwards to stay,\\nand for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.\\n\\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was\\nso effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,\\nand coolness of judgment, which qualified her,\\nthough only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,\\nand enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage\\nof them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood\\nwhich must generally have led to imprudence.  She had\\nan excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,\\nand her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;\\nand which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s abilities were, in many respects,\\nquite equal to Elinor\\'s. She was sensible and clever;\\nbut eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have\\nno moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she\\nwas everything but prudent.  The resemblance between\\nher and her mother was strikingly great.\\n\\nElinor saw, with concern, the excess of her\\nsister\\'s sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued\\nand cherished.  They encouraged each other now in the\\nviolence of their affliction.  The agony of grief\\nwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,\\nwas sought for, was created again and again.  They gave\\nthemselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase\\nof wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,\\nand resolved against ever admitting consolation\\nin future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still\\nshe could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could\\nconsult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law\\non her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\\nand could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,\\nand encourage her to similar forbearance.\\n\\nMargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,\\nwell-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed\\na good deal of Marianne\\'s romance, without having\\nmuch of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\\nto equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress\\nof Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded\\nto the condition of visitors.  As such, however, they were\\ntreated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband\\nwith as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really\\npressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland\\nas their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible\\nto Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could\\naccommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,\\nhis invitation was accepted.\\n\\nA continuance in a place where everything reminded\\nher of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.\\nIn seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful\\nthan hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine\\nexpectation of happiness which is happiness itself.\\nBut in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was\\nbeyond alloy.\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her\\nhusband intended to do for his sisters.  To take three\\nthousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy\\nwould be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.\\nShe begged him to think again on the subject.  How could\\nhe answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only\\nchild too, of so large a sum?  And what possible claim\\ncould the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by\\nhalf blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,\\nhave on his generosity to so large an amount.  It was very\\nwell known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages;\\nand why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry,\\nby giving away all his money to his half sisters?\\n\\n\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied\\nher husband, \"that I should assist his widow and daughters.\"\\n\\n\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say;\\nten to one but he was light-headed at the time.\\nHad he been in his right senses, he could not have thought\\nof such a thing as begging you to give away half your\\nfortune from your own child.\"\\n\\n\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum,\\nmy dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,\\nto assist them, and make their situation more comfortable\\nthan it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would\\nhave been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.\\nHe could hardly suppose I should neglect them.\\nBut as he required the promise, I could not do less\\nthan give it; at least I thought so at the time.\\nThe promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.\\nSomething must be done for them whenever they leave Norland\\nand settle in a new home.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, LET something be done for them;\\nbut THAT something need not be three thousand pounds.\\nConsider,\" she added, \"that when the money is once\\nparted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will marry,\\nand it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could\\nbe restored to our poor little boy--\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely,\\n\"that would make great difference.  The time may come when\\nHarry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.\\nIf he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would\\nbe a very convenient addition.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it would.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties,\\nif the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds\\nwould be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth\\nwould do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY\\nhis sisters!  And as it is--only half blood!--But you\\nhave such a generous spirit!\"\\n\\n\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.\\n\"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than\\ntoo little.  No one, at least, can think I have not\\ndone enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly\\nexpect more.\"\\n\\n\"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\"\\nsaid the lady, \"but we are not to think of their\\nexpectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five\\nhundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, without any addition\\nof mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds\\non their mother\\'s death--a very comfortable fortune\\nfor any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that\\nthey can want no addition at all.  They will have ten\\nthousand pounds divided amongst them.  If they marry,\\nthey will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,\\nthey may all live very comfortably together on the interest\\nof ten thousand pounds.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether,\\nupon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do\\nsomething for their mother while she lives, rather than\\nfor them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters\\nwould feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\nA hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\nHis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving\\nher consent to this plan.\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with\\nfifteen hundred pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood\\nshould live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"\\n\\n\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot\\nbe worth half that purchase.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always\\nlive for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;\\nand she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.\\nAn annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\\nand over every year, and there is no getting rid\\nof it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.\\nI have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;\\nfor my mother was clogged with the payment of three\\nto old superannuated servants by my father\\'s will,\\nand it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.\\nTwice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then\\nthere was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one\\nof them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned\\nout to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.\\nHer income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual\\nclaims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,\\nbecause, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at\\nmy mother\\'s disposal, without any restriction whatever.\\nIt has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am\\nsure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\nall the world.\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood,\\n\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.\\nOne\\'s fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one\\'s own.\\nTo be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,\\non every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away\\none\\'s independence.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.\\nThey think themselves secure, you do no more than what\\nis expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you,\\nwhatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.\\nI would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.\\nIt may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,\\nor even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better\\nthat there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I\\nmay give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\\nthan a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge\\ntheir style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,\\nand would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\\nof the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.\\nA present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent\\ntheir ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,\\nbe amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,\\nI am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\\nof your giving them any money at all.  The assistance\\nhe thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be\\nreasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking\\nout for a comfortable small house for them, helping them\\nto move their things, and sending them presents of fish\\nand game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.\\nI\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.\\nDo but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively\\ncomfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live\\non the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the\\nthousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings\\nthem in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,\\nthey will pay their mother for their board out of it.\\nAltogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,\\nand what on earth can four women want for more than\\nthat?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will\\nbe nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,\\nand hardly any servants; they will keep no company,\\nand can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive\\nhow comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am\\nsure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;\\nand as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think\\nof it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you\\nare perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean\\nnothing more by his request to me than what you say.\\nI clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\\nto them as you have described.  When my mother removes\\ninto another house my services shall be readily given\\nto accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present\\nof furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however,\\nONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother\\nmoved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill\\nwas sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,\\nand is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore\\nbe almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\\n\\n\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.\\nA valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would\\nhave been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice\\nas handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great\\ndeal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY\\ncan ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.\\nYour father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this:\\nthat you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention\\nto his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,\\nhe would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"\\n\\nThis argument was irresistible.  It gave to his\\nintentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he\\nfinally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,\\nif not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow\\nand children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly\\nacts as his own wife pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;\\nnot from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\\nwell known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\\nproduced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,\\nand her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\\nof heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,\\nshe was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries\\nfor a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;\\nfor to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.\\nBut she could hear of no situation that at once answered\\nher notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence\\nof her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected\\nseveral houses as too large for their income, which her\\nmother would have approved.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\\nsolemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,\\nwhich gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.\\nShe doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\\nhad doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters\\'\\nsake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would\\nsupport her in affluence.  For their brother\\'s sake, too,\\nfor the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she\\nreproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,\\nin believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive\\nbehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\ntheir welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,\\nshe firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.\\n\\nThe contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,\\nfelt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased\\nby the farther knowledge of her character, which half\\na year\\'s residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\\nin spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\\naffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long,\\nhad not a particular circumstance occurred to give\\nstill greater eligibility, according to the opinions\\nof Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters\\' continuance at Norland.\\n\\nThis circumstance was a growing attachment between\\nher eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,\\na gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced\\nto their acquaintance soon after his sister\\'s establishment\\nat Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part\\nof his time there.\\n\\nSome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\\nmotives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son\\nof a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed\\nit from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,\\nthe whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.\\nBut Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.\\nIt was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\\nthat he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned\\nthe partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of\\nher\\'s that difference of fortune should keep any couple\\nasunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;\\nand that Elinor\\'s merit should not be acknowledged\\nby every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\\n\\nEdward Ferrars was not recommended to their good\\nopinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.\\nHe was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy\\nto make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice\\nto himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open,\\naffectionate heart.  His understanding was good,\\nand his education had given it solid improvement.\\nBut he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\\nto answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed\\nto see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.\\nThey wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\\nmanner or other.  His mother wished to interest him in\\npolitical concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see\\nhim connected with some of the great men of the day.\\nMrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,\\ntill one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would\\nhave quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.\\nBut Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.\\nAll his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\\nof private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother\\nwho was more promising.\\n\\nEdward had been staying several weeks in the house\\nbefore he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s attention;\\nfor she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered\\nher careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he\\nwas quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.\\nHe did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\\nill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe\\nand approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor\\nchanced one day to make on the difference between him\\nand his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him\\nmost forcibly to her mother.\\n\\n\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike\\nFanny is enough.  It implies everything amiable.\\nI love him already.\"\\n\\n\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you\\nknow more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Like him!\" replied her mother with a smile.\\n\"I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.\"\\n\\n\"You may esteem him.\"\\n\\n\"I have never yet known what it was to separate\\nesteem and love.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.\\nHer manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.\\nShe speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion\\nof his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;\\nbut she really felt assured of his worth: and even that\\nquietness of manner, which militated against all her\\nestablished ideas of what a young man\\'s address ought to be,\\nwas no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be\\nwarm and his temper affectionate.\\n\\nNo sooner did she perceive any symptom of love\\nin his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their\\nserious attachment as certain, and looked forward\\nto their marriage as rapidly approaching.\\n\\n\"In a few months, my dear Marianne.\" said she,\\n\"Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.\\nWe shall miss her; but SHE will be happy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?\"\\n\\n\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.\\nWe shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall\\nmeet every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother,\\na real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion\\nin the world of Edward\\'s heart.  But you look grave,\\nMarianne; do you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it\\nwith some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love\\nhim tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young\\nman--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;\\nit has none of that grace which I should expect\\nin the man who could seriously attach my sister.\\nHis eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once\\nannounce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this,\\nI am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems\\nscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor\\'s\\ndrawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person\\nwho can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of\\nhis frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\\nhe knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,\\nnot as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters\\nmust be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose\\ntaste did not in every point coincide with my own.\\nHe must enter into all my feelings; the same books,\\nthe same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how spiritless,\\nhow tame was Edward\\'s manner in reading to us last night!\\nI felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it\\nwith so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.\\nI could hardly keep my seat.  To hear those beautiful lines\\nwhich have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced\\nwith such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"--\\n\\n\"He would certainly have done more justice to\\nsimple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;\\nbut you WOULD give him Cowper.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--\\nbut we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor has\\nnot my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and\\nbe happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,\\nhad I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\\nMama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced\\nthat I shall never see a man whom I can really love.\\nI require so much!  He must have all Edward\\'s virtues,\\nand his person and manners must ornament his goodness\\nwith every possible charm.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.\\nIt is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.\\nWhy should you be less fortunate than your mother?  In\\none circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be\\ndifferent from her\\'s!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\n\\n\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne,\\n\"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\"\\n\\n\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should\\nyou think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has\\ngreat pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,\\nand I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,\\nthough he has not had opportunities of improving it.\\nHad he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would\\nhave drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment\\nin such matters so much, that he is always unwilling\\nto give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate\\npropriety and simplicity of taste, which in general\\ndirect him perfectly right.\"\\n\\nMarianne was afraid of offending, and said no more\\non the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor\\ndescribed as excited in him by the drawings of other\\npeople, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,\\nin her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though\\nsmiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured\\nher sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\\n\\n\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not\\nconsider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think\\nI may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him\\nis perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,\\nI am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\\n\\nMarianne hardly knew what to say.  She would\\nnot wound the feelings of her sister on any account,\\nand yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.\\nAt length she replied:\\n\\n\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him\\nis not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.\\nI have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\\npropensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,\\nas you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world\\nof his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is\\nworthy and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile,\\n\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\\nwith such commendation as that.  I do not perceive\\nhow you could express yourself more warmly.\"\\n\\nMarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\\n\\n\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor,\\n\"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him\\noften enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.\\nThe excellence of his understanding and his principles\\ncan be concealed only by that shyness which too often\\nkeeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice\\nto his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities,\\nas you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\\nbeen kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have\\nbeen at times thrown a good deal together, while you\\nhave been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\\nprinciple by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,\\nhave studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\\nsubjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\\nI venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,\\nenjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,\\nhis observation just and correct, and his taste delicate\\nand pure.  His abilities in every respect improve\\nas much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\\nAt first sight, his address is certainly not striking;\\nand his person can hardly be called handsome, till the\\nexpression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,\\nand the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.\\nAt present, I know him so well, that I think him\\nreally handsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you,\\nMarianne?\"\\n\\n\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I\\ndo not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,\\nI shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do\\nin his heart.\"\\n\\nElinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for\\nthe warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.\\nShe felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.\\nShe believed the regard to be mutual; but she required\\ngreater certainty of it to make Marianne\\'s conviction\\nof their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that\\nwhat Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,\\nthey believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,\\nand to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain the real\\nstate of the case to her sister.\\n\\n\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think\\nvery highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\\n\\nMarianne here burst forth with indignation--\\n\\n\"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!\\nworse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.\\nUse those words again, and I will leave the room this moment.\"\\n\\nElinor could not help laughing.  \"Excuse me,\"\\nsaid she; \"and be assured that I meant no offence to you,\\nby speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.\\nBelieve them to be stronger than I have declared;\\nbelieve them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\\nsuspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,\\nwithout imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must\\nnot believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.\\nThere are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;\\nand till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder\\nat my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,\\nby believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart\\nI feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.\\nBut there are other points to be considered besides\\nhis inclination.  He is very far from being independent.\\nWhat his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny\\'s\\noccasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have\\nnever been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very\\nmuch mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there\\nwould be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish\\nto marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\\nhigh rank.\"\\n\\nMarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination\\nof her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.\\n\\n\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.\\n\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages\\nwill proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon,\\nand Edward will have greater opportunity of improving\\nthat natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.\\nOh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to\\nlearn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"\\n\\nElinor had given her real opinion to her sister.\\nShe could not consider her partiality for Edward\\nin so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.\\nThere was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,\\nif it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost\\nas unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him\\nto feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.\\nIt would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind\\nwhich frequently attended him.  A more reasonable cause\\nmight be found in the dependent situation which forbade\\nthe indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother\\nneither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable\\nat present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form\\na home for himself, without strictly attending to her views\\nfor his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,\\nit was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.\\nShe was far from depending on that result of his preference\\nof her, which her mother and sister still considered\\nas certain.  Nay, the longer they were together the more\\ndoubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,\\nfor a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\\nthan friendship.\\n\\nBut, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,\\nwhen perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,\\nand at the same time, (which was still more common,)\\nto make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of\\naffronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to\\nher so expressively of her brother\\'s great expectations,\\nof Mrs. Ferrars\\'s resolution that both her sons should\\nmarry well, and of the danger attending any young woman\\nwho attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could\\nneither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.\\nShe gave her an answer which marked her contempt,\\nand instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might\\nbe the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,\\nher beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week\\nto such insinuations.\\n\\nIn this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered\\nto her from the post, which contained a proposal\\nparticularly well timed.  It was the offer of a small house,\\non very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,\\na gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.\\nThe letter was from this gentleman himself, and written\\nin the true spirit of friendly accommodation.\\nHe understood that she was in need of a dwelling;\\nand though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which\\nshe might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.\\nHe earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars\\nof the house and garden, to come with her daughters to\\nBarton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence\\nshe might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the\\nhouses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,\\nbe made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\\nin so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\\nto his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\\nnearer connections.  She needed no time for deliberation\\nor inquiry.  Her resolution was formed as she read.\\nThe situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from\\nSussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,\\nwould have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\\npossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its\\nfirst recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland\\nwas no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;\\nit was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing\\nher daughter-in-law\\'s guest; and to remove for ever\\nfrom that beloved place would be less painful than to\\ninhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.\\nShe instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment\\nof his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\\nand then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,\\nthat she might be secure of their approbation before her\\nanswer were sent.\\n\\nElinor had always thought it would be more prudent\\nfor them to settle at some distance from Norland,\\nthan immediately amongst their present acquaintance.\\nOn THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\\nher mother\\'s intention of removing into Devonshire.\\nThe house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so\\nsimple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,\\nas to leave her no right of objection on either point;\\nand, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought\\nany charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from\\nthe vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made\\nno attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter\\nof acquiescence.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood\\nindulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her\\nson-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,\\nand should incommode them no longer than till every thing were\\nready for her inhabiting it.  They heard her with surprise.\\nMrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly\\nhoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\\nShe had great satisfaction in replying that she was going\\ninto Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her,\\non hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,\\nwhich required no explanation to her, repeated,\\n\"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?  So far from hence!\\nAnd to what part of it?\"  She explained the situation.\\nIt was within four miles northward of Exeter.\\n\\n\"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope\\nto see many of my friends in it.  A room or two can\\neasily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty\\nin travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find\\nnone in accommodating them.\"\\n\\nShe concluded with a very kind invitation to\\nMr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;\\nand to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.\\nThough her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had\\nmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than\\nwas unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect\\non her in that point to which it principally tended.\\nTo separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her\\nobject as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nby this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she\\ndisregarded her disapprobation of the match.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again\\nhow exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\\nsuch a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any\\nservice to her in removing her furniture.  He really felt\\nconscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion\\nto which he had limited the performance of his promise to\\nhis father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--\\nThe furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly\\nconsisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,\\nwith a handsome pianoforte of Marianne\\'s.  Mrs. John\\nDashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could\\nnot help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood\\'s income\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own,\\nshe should have any handsome article of furniture.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was\\nready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.\\nNo difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she\\nwaited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland,\\nand to determine her future household, before she set\\noff for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid\\nin the performance of everything that interested her,\\nwas soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband\\nhad been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity\\nnow offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed\\nto sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her\\neldest daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she\\nconsulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;\\nbut the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom\\ntoo limited the number of their servants to three;\\ntwo maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided\\nfrom amongst those who had formed their establishment\\nat Norland.\\n\\nThe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately\\ninto Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress\\'s\\narrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown\\nto Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the\\ncottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied\\nso undoubtingly on Sir John\\'s description of the house,\\nas to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she\\nentered it as her own.  Her eagerness to be gone from Norland\\nwas preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction\\nof her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;\\na satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\\nunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\\nNow was the time when her son-in-law\\'s promise to his\\nfather might with particular propriety be fulfilled.\\nSince he had neglected to do it on first coming to\\nthe estate, their quitting his house might be looked\\non as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.\\nBut Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every\\nhope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general\\ndrift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no\\nfarther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.\\nHe so frequently talked of the increasing expenses\\nof housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,\\nwhich a man of any consequence in the world was beyond\\ncalculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand\\nin need of more money himself than to have any design of\\ngiving money away.\\n\\nIn a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir\\nJohn Middleton\\'s first letter to Norland, every thing was\\nso far settled in their future abode as to enable\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.\\n\\nMany were the tears shed by them in their last\\nadieus to a place so much beloved.  \"Dear, dear Norland!\"\\nsaid Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,\\non the last evening of their being there; \"when shall I cease\\nto regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!\\nhappy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing\\nyou from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view\\nyou no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you\\nwill continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we\\nare removed, nor any branch become motionless although we\\ncan observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;\\nunconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,\\nand insensible of any change in those who walk under your\\nshade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\n\\nThe first part of their journey was performed in too\\nmelancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious\\nand unpleasant.  But as they drew towards the end of it,\\ntheir interest in the appearance of a country which they\\nwere to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of\\nBarton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.\\nIt was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich\\nin pasture.  After winding along it for more than a mile,\\nthey reached their own house.  A small green court was\\nthe whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate\\nadmitted them into it.\\n\\nAs a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable\\nand compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the\\nbuilding was regular, the roof was tiled, the window\\nshutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered\\nwith honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through\\nthe house into the garden behind.  On each side of the\\nentrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;\\nand beyond them were the offices and the stairs.\\nFour bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.\\nIt had not been built many years and was in good repair.\\nIn comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered\\nthe house were soon dried away.  They were cheered\\nby the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each\\nfor the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\\nIt was very early in September; the season was fine,\\nand from first seeing the place under the advantage\\nof good weather, they received an impression in its\\nfavour which was of material service in recommending\\nit to their lasting approbation.\\n\\nThe situation of the house was good.  High hills rose\\nimmediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;\\nsome of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.\\nThe village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,\\nand formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.\\nThe prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the\\nwhole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.\\nThe hills which surrounded the cottage terminated\\nthe valley in that direction; under another name,\\nand in another course, it branched out again between two\\nof the steepest of them.\\n\\nWith the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood\\nwas upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former\\nstyle of life rendered many additions to the latter\\nindispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;\\nand she had at this time ready money enough to supply all\\nthat was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.\\n\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is\\ntoo small for our family, but we will make ourselves\\ntolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late\\nin the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring,\\nif I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\\nthink about building.  These parlors are both too small\\nfor such parties of our friends as I hope to see often\\ncollected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the\\npassage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,\\nand so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;\\nthis, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,\\nand a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\\nlittle cottage.  I could wish the stairs were handsome.\\nBut one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it\\nwould be no difficult matter to widen them.  I shall see\\nhow much I am before-hand with the world in the spring,\\nand we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\\n\\nIn the mean time, till all these alterations could\\nbe made from the savings of an income of five hundred\\na-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were\\nwise enough to be contented with the house as it was;\\nand each of them was busy in arranging their particular\\nconcerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books\\nand other possessions, to form themselves a home.\\nMarianne\\'s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;\\nand Elinor\\'s drawings were affixed to the walls of their\\nsitting room.\\n\\nIn such employments as these they were interrupted\\nsoon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of\\ntheir landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,\\nand to offer them every accommodation from his own house\\nand garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.\\nSir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.\\nHe had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long\\nfor his young cousins to remember him.  His countenance\\nwas thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were\\nas friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival\\nseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort\\nto be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much\\nof his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\\nterms with his family, and pressed them so cordially\\nto dine at Barton Park every day till they were better\\nsettled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could\\nnot give offence.  His kindness was not confined to words;\\nfor within an hour after he left them, a large basket\\nfull of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,\\nwhich was followed before the end of the day by a present\\nof game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\\nletters to and from the post for them, and would not be\\ndenied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper\\nevery day.\\n\\nLady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him,\\ndenoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as\\nshe could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;\\nand as this message was answered by an invitation\\nequally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.\\n\\nThey were, of course, very anxious to see a person on\\nwhom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the\\nelegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.\\nLady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;\\nher face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\\nand her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance\\nwhich her husband\\'s wanted.  But they would have been\\nimproved by some share of his frankness and warmth;\\nand her visit was long enough to detract something from\\ntheir first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly\\nwell-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say\\nfor herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.\\n\\nConversation however was not wanted, for Sir John\\nwas very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise\\nprecaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine\\nlittle boy about six years old, by which means there was\\none subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case\\nof extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,\\nadmire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother\\nanswered for him, while he hung about her and held\\ndown his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,\\nwho wondered at his being so shy before company, as he\\ncould make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit\\na child ought to be of the party, by way of provision\\nfor discourse.  In the present case it took up ten minutes\\nto determine whether the boy were most like his father\\nor mother, and in what particular he resembled either,\\nfor of course every body differed, and every body was\\nastonished at the opinion of the others.\\n\\nAn opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods\\nof debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John\\nwould not leave the house without securing their promise\\nof dining at the park the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\n\\nBarton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.\\nThe ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,\\nbut it was screened from their view at home by the\\nprojection of a hill.  The house was large and handsome;\\nand the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\nand elegance.  The former was for Sir John\\'s gratification,\\nthe latter for that of his lady.  They were scarcely\\never without some friends staying with them in the house,\\nand they kept more company of every kind than any other\\nfamily in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to the\\nhappiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper\\nand outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other\\nin that total want of talent and taste which confined\\ntheir employments, unconnected with such as society produced,\\nwithin a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a sportsman,\\nLady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she\\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources.\\nLady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her\\nchildren all the year round, while Sir John\\'s independent\\nemployments were in existence only half the time.\\nContinual engagements at home and abroad, however,\\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;\\nsupported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise\\nto the good breeding of his wife.\\n\\nLady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance\\nof her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;\\nand from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment\\nin any of their parties.  But Sir John\\'s satisfaction\\nin society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold,\\nand the noisier they were the better was he pleased.\\nHe was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,\\nfor in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold\\nham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private\\nballs were numerous enough for any young lady who was not\\nsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.\\n\\nThe arrival of a new family in the country was always\\na matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was\\ncharmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his\\ncottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,\\nand unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion;\\nfor to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could\\nwant to make her mind as captivating as her person.\\nThe friendliness of his disposition made him happy in\\naccommodating those, whose situation might be considered,\\nin comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In showing\\nkindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only\\nin his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;\\nfor a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who\\nare sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging\\ntheir taste by admitting them to a residence within his own\\nmanor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door\\nof the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton\\nPark with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them\\nto the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern\\nwhich the same subject had drawn from him the day before,\\nat being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.\\nThey would see, he said, only one gentleman there\\nbesides himself; a particular friend who was staying at\\nthe park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.\\nHe hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,\\nand could assure them it should never happen so again.\\nHe had been to several families that morning in hopes\\nof procuring some addition to their number, but it\\nwas moonlight and every body was full of engagements.\\nLuckily Lady Middleton\\'s mother had arrived at Barton\\nwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful\\nagreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find\\nit so very dull as they might imagine.  The young ladies,\\nas well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with\\nhaving two entire strangers of the party, and wished for\\nno more.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton\\'s mother, was a\\ngood-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a\\ngreat deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.  She was full\\nof jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said\\nmany witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;\\nhoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.\\nMarianne was vexed at it for her sister\\'s sake, and turned\\nher eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,\\nwith an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than\\ncould arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings\\'s.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no\\nmore adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,\\nthan Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings\\nto be Lady Middleton\\'s mother.  He was silent and grave.\\nHis appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\\nof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret\\nan absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side\\nof five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,\\nhis countenance was sensible, and his address was\\nparticularly gentlemanlike.\\n\\nThere was nothing in any of the party which could\\nrecommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold\\ninsipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive,\\nthat in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,\\nand even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\\nmother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed\\nto be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her\\nfour noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,\\ntore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse\\nexcept what related to themselves.\\n\\nIn the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical,\\nshe was invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked,\\nevery body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,\\nwho sang very well, at their request went through the\\nchief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain\\never since in the same position on the pianoforte,\\nfor her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving\\nup music, although by her mother\\'s account, she had\\nplayed extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s performance was highly applauded.\\nSir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,\\nand as loud in his conversation with the others while every\\nsong lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,\\nwondered how any one\\'s attention could be diverted from music\\nfor a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song\\nwhich Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone,\\nof all the party, heard her without being in raptures.\\nHe paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt\\na respect for him on the occasion, which the others had\\nreasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.\\nHis pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that\\necstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible\\ninsensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough\\nto allow that a man of five and thirty might well have\\noutlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite\\npower of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make\\nevery allowance for the colonel\\'s advanced state of life\\nwhich humanity required.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.\\nShe had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived\\nto see respectably married, and she had now therefore\\nnothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.\\nIn the promotion of this object she was zealously active,\\nas far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity\\nof projecting weddings among all the young people\\nof her acquaintance.  She was remarkably quick in the\\ndiscovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage\\nof raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young\\nlady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;\\nand this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her\\narrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel\\nBrandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.\\nShe rather suspected it to be so, on the very first\\nevening of their being together, from his listening\\nso attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit\\nwas returned by the Middletons\\' dining at the cottage,\\nthe fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.\\nIt must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.\\nIt would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE\\nwas handsome.  Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see\\nColonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection\\nwith Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every\\npretty girl.\\n\\nThe immediate advantage to herself was by no means\\ninconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes\\nagainst them both.  At the park she laughed at the colonel,\\nand in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former her\\nraillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\\nperfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at\\nfirst incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,\\nshe hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,\\nor censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an\\nunfeeling reflection on the colonel\\'s advanced years,\\nand on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years\\nyounger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared\\nto the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear\\nMrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw\\nridicule on his age.\\n\\n\"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity\\nof the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally\\nill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than\\nMrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father;\\nand if he were ever animated enough to be in love,\\nmust have long outlived every sensation of the kind.\\nIt is too ridiculous!  When is a man to be safe from such wit,\\nif age and infirmity will not protect him?\"\\n\\n\"Infirmity!\" said Elinor, \"do you call Colonel Brandon\\ninfirm?  I can easily suppose that his age may appear much\\ngreater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly\\ndeceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!\"\\n\\n\"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?\\nand is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?\"\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing,\\n\"at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay;\\nand it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been\\nextended to the advanced age of forty.\"\\n\\n\"Mamma, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well\\nthat Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends\\nyet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.\\nHe may live twenty years longer.  But thirty-five has\\nnothing to do with matrimony.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had\\nbetter not have any thing to do with matrimony together.\\nBut if there should by any chance happen to be a woman\\nwho is single at seven and twenty, I should not think\\nColonel Brandon\\'s being thirty-five any objection to his\\nmarrying HER.\"\\n\\n\"A woman of seven and twenty,\" said Marianne,\\nafter pausing a moment, \"can never hope to feel or inspire\\naffection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,\\nor her fortune small, I can suppose that she might\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,\\nfor the sake of the provision and security of a wife.\\nIn his marrying such a woman therefore there would be\\nnothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of convenience,\\nand the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would\\nbe no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.\\nTo me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which\\neach wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\"\\n\\n\"It would be impossible, I know,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could\\nfeel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough\\nto love, to make him a desirable companion to her.\\nBut I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and\\nhis wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,\\nmerely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a\\nvery cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one\\nof his shoulders.\"\\n\\n\"But he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said Marianne;\\n\"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected\\nwith aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of\\nailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.\"\\n\\n\"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not\\nhave despised him half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not\\nthere something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,\\nhollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"\\n\\nSoon after this, upon Elinor\\'s leaving the room,\\n\"Mamma,\" said Marianne, \"I have an alarm on the subject\\nof illness which I cannot conceal from you.  I am sure\\nEdward Ferrars is not well.  We have now been here almost\\na fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but real\\nindisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.\\nWhat else can detain him at Norland?\"\\n\\n\"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood.  \"I had none.  On the contrary,\\nif I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has\\nbeen in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\\nof pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,\\nwhen I talked of his coming to Barton.  Does Elinor\\nexpect him already?\"\\n\\n\"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course\\nshe must.\"\\n\\n\"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I\\nwas talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate\\nfor the spare bedchamber, she observed that there\\nwas no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely\\nthat the room would be wanted for some time.\"\\n\\n\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!\\nBut the whole of their behaviour to each other has been\\nunaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last\\nadieus! How languid their conversation the last evening\\nof their being together! In Edward\\'s farewell there was no\\ndistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes\\nof an affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave\\nthem purposely together in the course of the last morning,\\nand each time did he most unaccountably follow me out\\nof the room.  And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward,\\ncried not as I did.  Even now her self-command is invariable.\\nWhen is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try\\nto avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied\\nin it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable\\ncomfort to themselves.  The house and the garden, with all\\nthe objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,\\nand the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland\\nhalf its charms were engaged in again with far greater\\nenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the\\nloss of their father.  Sir John Middleton, who called\\non them every day for the first fortnight, and who was\\nnot in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,\\ncould not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.\\n\\nTheir visitors, except those from Barton Park,\\nwere not many; for, in spite of Sir John\\'s urgent entreaties\\nthat they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated\\nassurances of his carriage being always at their service,\\nthe independence of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s spirit overcame the\\nwish of society for her children; and she was resolute\\nin declining to visit any family beyond the distance\\nof a walk.  There were but few who could be so classed;\\nand it was not all of them that were attainable.\\nAbout a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow\\nwinding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,\\nas formerly described, the girls had, in one of their\\nearliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking\\nmansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland,\\ninterested their imagination and made them wish to be\\nbetter acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry,\\nthat its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,\\nwas unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,\\nand never stirred from home.\\n\\nThe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.\\nThe high downs which invited them from almost every window\\nof the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air\\non their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt\\nof the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;\\nand towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret\\none memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\\npartial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear\\nthe confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding\\ndays had occasioned.  The weather was not tempting enough\\nto draw the two others from their pencil and their book,\\nin spite of Marianne\\'s declaration that the day would\\nbe lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would\\nbe drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\\ntogether.\\n\\nThey gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own\\npenetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they\\ncaught in their faces the animating gales of a high\\nsouth-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented\\ntheir mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.\\n\\n\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne,\\n\"superior to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least\\ntwo hours.\"\\n\\nMargaret agreed, and they pursued their way against\\nthe wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about\\ntwenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over\\ntheir heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--\\nChagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,\\nto turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.\\nOne consolation however remained for them, to which the\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;\\nit was that of running with all possible speed down the steep\\nside of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.\\n\\nThey set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage,\\nbut a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;\\nand Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,\\nwas involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom\\nin safety.\\n\\nA gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers\\nplaying round him, was passing up the hill and within\\na few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.\\nHe put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She had\\nraised herself from the ground, but her foot had been\\ntwisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.\\nThe gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her\\nmodesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,\\ntook her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried\\nher down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,\\nthe gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her\\ndirectly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived,\\nand quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair\\nin the parlour.\\n\\nElinor and her mother rose up in amazement at\\ntheir entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed\\non him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration\\nwhich equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized\\nfor his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner\\nso frank and so graceful that his person, which was\\nuncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice\\nand expression.  Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,\\nthe gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\\nhave been secured by any act of attention to her child;\\nbut the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,\\ngave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.\\n\\nShe thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness\\nof address which always attended her, invited him to\\nbe seated.  But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.\\nMrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.\\nHis name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present\\nhome was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would\\nallow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire\\nafter Miss Dashwood.  The honour was readily granted,\\nand he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,\\nin the midst of a heavy rain.\\n\\nHis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness\\nwere instantly the theme of general admiration,\\nand the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne\\nreceived particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--\\nMarianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,\\nfor the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his\\nlifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding\\nhim after their entering the house.  But she had seen\\nenough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,\\nand with an energy which always adorned her praise.\\nHis person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever\\ndrawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying\\nher into the house with so little previous formality, there\\nwas a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended\\nthe action to her.  Every circumstance belonging to him\\nwas interesting.  His name was good, his residence was in\\ntheir favourite village, and she soon found out that of all\\nmanly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.\\nHer imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,\\nand the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.\\n\\nSir John called on them as soon as the next interval\\nof fair weather that morning allowed him to get out\\nof doors; and Marianne\\'s accident being related to him,\\nhe was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\\nof the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\\n\\n\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE\\nin the country? That is good news however; I will\\nride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\\n\\n\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here\\nevery year.\"\\n\\n\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\\n\\n\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.\\nA very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider\\nin England.\"\\n\\n\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,\\nindignantly.  \"But what are his manners on more intimate\\nacquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\\n\\nSir John was rather puzzled.\\n\\n\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him\\nas to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,\\nand has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\\nI ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"\\n\\nBut Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\\ncolour of Mr. Willoughby\\'s pointer, than he could\\ndescribe to her the shades of his mind.\\n\\n\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come\\nfrom?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"\\n\\nOn this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;\\nand he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property\\nof his own in the country; that he resided there only\\nwhile he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,\\nto whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\\nto inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth\\ncatching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty\\nlittle estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;\\nand if I were you, I would not give him up to my\\nyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.\\nMiss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.\\nBrandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a\\ngood humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded\\nby the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what\\nyou call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which\\nthey have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us,\\nlet them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however,\\nfrom what you say, that he is a respectable young man,\\nand one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\\n\\n\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,\\nas ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember\\nlast Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced\\nfrom eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\\n\\n\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes,\\n\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\\n\\n\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought\\nto be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them\\nshould know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see\\nhow it will be.  You will be setting your cap at him now,\\nand never think of poor Brandon.\"\\n\\n\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne,\\nwarmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every\\ncommon-place phrase by which wit is intended; and \\'setting\\none\\'s cap at a man,\\' or \\'making a conquest,\\' are the most\\nodious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;\\nand if their construction could ever be deemed clever,\\ntime has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\\n\\nSir John did not much understand this reproof;\\nbut he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,\\n\\n\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,\\none way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,\\nand he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can\\ntell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\\nof ankles.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\n\\nMarianne\\'s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance\\nthan precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage\\nearly the next morning to make his personal enquiries.\\nHe was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;\\nwith a kindness which Sir John\\'s account of him and her own\\ngratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during\\nthe visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,\\nmutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family\\nto whom accident had now introduced him.  Of their\\npersonal charms he had not required a second interview\\nto be convinced.\\n\\nMiss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,\\nregular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.\\nMarianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so\\ncorrect as her sister\\'s, in having the advantage of height,\\nwas more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when\\nin the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,\\ntruth was less violently outraged than usually happens.\\nHer skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,\\nher complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features\\nwere all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;\\nand in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,\\na spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen\\nwithout delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at\\nfirst held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance\\nof his assistance created.  But when this passed away,\\nwhen her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the\\nperfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness\\nand vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond,\\nshe gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\\nlargest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\\nof his stay.\\n\\nIt was only necessary to mention any favourite\\namusement to engage her to talk.  She could not be\\nsilent when such points were introduced, and she\\nhad neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.\\nThey speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\\nand music was mutual, and that it arose from a general\\nconformity of judgment in all that related to either.\\nEncouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\\nshe proceeded to question him on the subject of books;\\nher favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\\nupon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of\\nfive and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to\\nbecome an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,\\nhowever disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly alike.\\nThe same books, the same passages were idolized by each--\\nor if any difference appeared, any objection arose,\\nit lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\\nand the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.\\nHe acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;\\nand long before his visit concluded, they conversed\\nwith the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\\n\\n\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,\\n\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.\\nYou have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby\\'s opinion in\\nalmost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks\\nof Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating\\ntheir beauties as he ought, and you have received every\\nassurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\\nBut how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?\\nYou will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.\\nAnother meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\\non picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then\\nyou can have nothing farther to ask.\"--\\n\\n\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this\\njust? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.\\nI have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.\\nI have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;\\nI have been open and sincere where I ought to have\\nbeen reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had\\nI talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I\\nspoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have\\nbeen spared.\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended\\nwith Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold\\nher myself, if she were capable of wishing to check\\nthe delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--\\nMarianne was softened in a moment.\\n\\nWilloughby, on his side, gave every proof of his\\npleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish\\nof improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.\\nTo enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the\\nencouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\\ngreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it\\nhad ceased to be possible, by Marianne\\'s perfect recovery.\\nShe was confined for some days to the house; but never had\\nany confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young\\nman of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,\\nand open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed\\nto engage Marianne\\'s heart, for with all this, he joined\\nnot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour\\nof mind which was now roused and increased by the example\\nof her own, and which recommended him to her affection\\nbeyond every thing else.\\n\\nHis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.\\nThey read, they talked, they sang together; his musical\\ntalents were considerable; and he read with all the\\nsensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.\\n\\nIn Mrs. Dashwood\\'s estimation he was as faultless\\nas in Marianne\\'s; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him\\nbut a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\\ndelighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on\\nevery occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.\\nIn hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,\\nin sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\\nof undivided attention where his heart was engaged,\\nand in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,\\nhe displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,\\nin spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.\\n\\nMarianne began now to perceive that the desperation\\nwhich had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever\\nseeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,\\nhad been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all\\nthat her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\\nand in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;\\nand his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\\nas earnest, as his abilities were strong.\\n\\nHer mother too, in whose mind not one speculative\\nthought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect\\nof riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and\\nexpect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having\\ngained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s partiality for Marianne, which had\\nso early been discovered by his friends, now first became\\nperceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed\\nby them.  Their attention and wit were drawn off to his\\nmore fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other\\nhad incurred before any partiality arose, was removed\\nwhen his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\\nso justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,\\nthough unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which\\nMrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,\\nwere now actually excited by her sister; and that however\\na general resemblance of disposition between the parties\\nmight forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally\\nstriking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\\nregard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;\\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,\\nwhen opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as\\nshe could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished\\nhim indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity\\nand reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\\nHis manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve\\nappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\\nthan of any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John\\nhad dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,\\nwhich justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,\\nand she regarded him with respect and compassion.\\n\\nPerhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\\nbecause he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,\\nwho, prejudiced against him for being neither lively\\nnor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\\n\\n\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby\\none day, when they were talking of him together,\\n\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;\\nwhom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\\nto talk to.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it\\nis injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed\\nby all the family at the park, and I never see him myself\\nwithout taking pains to converse with him.\"\\n\\n\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby,\\n\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem\\nof the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would\\nsubmit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\\nas Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command\\nthe indifference of any body else?\"\\n\\n\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\\nand Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady\\nMiddleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,\\nyour censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,\\nthan you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\\n\\n\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"\\n\\n\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;\\nand sense will always have attractions for me.\\nYes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.\\nHe has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,\\nhas read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him\\ncapable of giving me much information on various subjects;\\nand he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\\ngood-breeding and good nature.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously,\\n\"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,\\nand the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"\\n\\n\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made\\nany such inquiries, but they happened to be points\\non which I had been previously informed.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may\\nhave extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,\\nand palanquins.\"\\n\\n\"I may venture to say that HIS observations\\nhave stretched much further than your candour.\\nBut why should you dislike him?\"\\n\\n\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,\\nas a very respectable man, who has every body\\'s good word,\\nand nobody\\'s notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\\nmore time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats\\nevery year.\"\\n\\n\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has\\nneither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding\\nhas no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice\\nno expression.\"\\n\\n\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"\\nreplied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your\\nown imagination, that the commendation I am able to give\\nof him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only\\npronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,\\nof gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using\\nme unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,\\nand to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.\\nYou shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have\\nthree unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;\\nhe threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;\\nhe has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,\\nand I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it\\nwill be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,\\nthat I believe his character to be in other respects\\nirreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return\\nfor an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,\\nyou cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\\nas ever.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\n\\nLittle had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined\\nwhen they first came into Devonshire, that so many\\nengagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly\\npresented themselves, or that they should have such frequent\\ninvitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\\nleisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.\\nWhen Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home\\nand abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,\\nwere put into execution.  The private balls at the park\\nthen began; and parties on the water were made and\\naccomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\\nIn every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;\\nand the ease and familiarity which naturally attended\\nthese parties were exactly calculated to give increasing\\nintimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford\\nhim opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne,\\nof marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\\nin her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance\\nof her affection.\\n\\nElinor could not be surprised at their attachment.\\nShe only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once\\nor twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some\\nself-command to Marianne.  But Marianne abhorred all\\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;\\nand to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\\nin themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely\\nan unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection\\nof reason to common-place and mistaken notions.\\nWilloughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\\nall times, was an illustration of their opinions.\\n\\nWhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else.\\nEvery thing he did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.\\nIf their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,\\nhe cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get\\nher a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement\\nof the night, they were partners for half the time;\\nand when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,\\nwere careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word\\nto any body else.  Such conduct made them of course\\nmost exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,\\nand seemed hardly to provoke them.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with\\na warmth which left her no inclination for checking this\\nexcessive display of them.  To her it was but the natural\\nconsequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.\\n\\nThis was the season of happiness to Marianne.\\nHer heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment\\nto Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,\\nwas more likely to be softened than she had thought it\\npossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed\\non her present home.\\n\\nElinor\\'s happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not\\nso much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements\\nso pure.  They afforded her no companion that could make\\namends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach\\nher to think of Norland with less regret than ever.\\nNeither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply\\nto her the conversation she missed; although the latter\\nwas an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded\\nher with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\\nher discourse.  She had already repeated her own history\\nto Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor\\'s memory been\\nequal to her means of improvement, she might have known\\nvery early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\\nMr. Jenning\\'s last illness, and what he said to his wife\\na few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more\\nagreeable than her mother only in being more silent.\\nElinor needed little observation to perceive that her\\nreserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\\nhad nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she\\nwas the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore\\nneither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing\\nto say one day that she had not said the day before.\\nHer insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were\\nalways the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\\narranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted\\nin style and her two eldest children attended her,\\nshe never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them\\nthan she might have experienced in sitting at home;--\\nand so little did her presence add to the pleasure\\nof the others, by any share in their conversation,\\nthat they were sometimes only reminded of her being\\namongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\\n\\nIn Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,\\ndid Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the\\nrespect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,\\nor give pleasure as a companion.  Willoughby was out\\nof the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her\\nsisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;\\nhis attentions were wholly Marianne\\'s, and a far less\\nagreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.\\nColonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such\\nencouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing\\nwith Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\nindifference of her sister.\\n\\nElinor\\'s compassion for him increased, as she had reason\\nto suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\\nbeen known to him.  This suspicion was given by some words\\nwhich accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,\\nwhen they were sitting down together by mutual consent,\\nwhile the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed\\non Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,\\nhe said, with a faint smile, \"Your sister, I understand,\\ndoes not approve of second attachments.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\\n\\n\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them\\nimpossible to exist.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it\\nwithout reflecting on the character of her own father,\\nwho had himself two wives, I know not.  A few years\\nhowever will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\\nof common sense and observation; and then they may be\\nmore easy to define and to justify than they now are,\\nby any body but herself.\"\\n\\n\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied;\\n\"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices\\nof a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way\\nto the reception of more general opinions.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.\\n\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings\\nas Marianne\\'s, which all the charms of enthusiasm and\\nignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have\\nall the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;\\nand a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause he resumed the conversation\\nby saying,--\\n\\n\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections\\nagainst a second attachment? or is it equally criminal\\nin every body?  Are those who have been disappointed\\nin their first choice, whether from the inconstancy\\nof its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,\\nto be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae\\nof her principles.  I only know that I never yet heard her\\nadmit any instance of a second attachment\\'s being pardonable.\"\\n\\n\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,\\na total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;\\nfor when the romantic refinements of a young mind\\nare obliged to give way, how frequently are they\\nsucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\\ndangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady\\nwho in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,\\nwho thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced\\nchange--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--\\nHere he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said\\ntoo much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered Elinor\\'s head.\\nThe lady would probably have passed without suspicion,\\nhad he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned\\nher ought not to escape his lips.  As it was,\\nit required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\\nemotion with the tender recollection of past regard.\\nElinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,\\nwould not have done so little.  The whole story would\\nhave been speedily formed under her active imagination;\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order\\nof disastrous love.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\n\\nAs Elinor and Marianne were walking together the\\nnext morning the latter communicated a piece of news\\nto her sister, which in spite of all that she knew\\nbefore of Marianne\\'s imprudence and want of thought,\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.\\nMarianne told her, with the greatest delight, that\\nWilloughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred\\nhimself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering\\nthat it was not in her mother\\'s plan to keep any horse,\\nthat if she were to alter her resolution in favour of\\nthis gift, she must buy another for the servant, and\\nkeep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\\nto receive them, she had accepted the present without\\nhesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.\\n\\n\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire\\nimmediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we\\nwill ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.\\nImagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop\\non some of these downs.\"\\n\\nMost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of\\nfelicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended\\nthe affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.\\nAs to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;\\nMamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse\\nwould do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;\\nas to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.\\nElinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving\\nsuch a present from a man so little, or at least so lately\\nknown to her.  This was too much.\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly,\\n\"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.\\nI have not known him long indeed, but I am much better\\nacquainted with him, than I am with any other creature\\nin the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not\\ntime or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--\\nit is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient\\nto make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others.  I should hold\\nmyself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse\\nfrom my brother, than from Willoughby.  Of John I know\\nvery little, though we have lived together for years;\\nbut of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.\\nShe knew her sister\\'s temper.  Opposition on so tender a\\nsubject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.\\nBut by an appeal to her affection for her mother,\\nby representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be\\nthe case) she consented to this increase of establishment,\\nMarianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to\\ntempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning\\nthe offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,\\nthat it must be declined.\\n\\nShe was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby\\ncalled at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her\\nexpress her disappointment to him in a low voice, on\\nbeing obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.\\nThe reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\\nand they were such as to make further entreaty on his\\nside impossible.  His concern however was very apparent;\\nand after expressing it with earnestness, he added,\\nin the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is\\nstill yours, though you cannot use it now.  I shall keep\\nit only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton\\nto form your own establishment in a more lasting home,\\nQueen Mab shall receive you.\"\\n\\nThis was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the\\nwhole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,\\nand in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone,\\nshe instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning\\nso direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.\\nFrom that moment she doubted not of their being engaged\\nto each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise\\nthan that she, or any of their friends, should be left\\nby tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.\\n\\nMargaret related something to her the next day,\\nwhich placed this matter in a still clearer light.\\nWilloughby had spent the preceding evening with them,\\nand Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\\nwith only him and Marianne, had had opportunity\\nfor observations, which, with a most important face,\\nshe communicated to her eldest sister, when they were\\nnext by themselves.\\n\\n\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to\\ntell you about Marianne.  I am sure she will be married\\nto Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"\\n\\n\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every\\nday since they first met on High-church Down; and they\\nhad not known each other a week, I believe, before you\\nwere certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;\\nbut it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.\"\\n\\n\"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure\\nthey will be married very soon, for he has got a lock\\nof her hair.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair\\nof some great uncle of HIS.\"\\n\\n\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne\\'s. I am almost\\nsure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  Last night\\nafter tea, when you and mama went out of the room,\\nthey were whispering and talking together as fast as\\ncould be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,\\nand presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\\nlock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;\\nand he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;\\nand put it into his pocket-book.\"\\n\\nFor such particulars, stated on such authority,\\nElinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed\\nto it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with\\nwhat she had heard and seen herself.\\n\\nMargaret\\'s sagacity was not always displayed in a\\nway so satisfactory to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings\\nattacked her one evening at the park, to give the name\\nof the young man who was Elinor\\'s particular favourite,\\nwhich had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\\nMargaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,\\n\"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?\"\\n\\nThis of course made every body laugh; and Elinor\\ntried to laugh too.  But the effort was painful.\\nShe was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person\\nwhose name she could not bear with composure to become\\na standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nMarianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did\\nmore harm than good to the cause, by turning very red\\nand saying in an angry manner to Margaret,\\n\\n\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be,\\nyou have no right to repeat them.\"\\n\\n\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret;\\n\"it was you who told me of it yourself.\"\\n\\nThis increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret\\nwas eagerly pressed to say something more.\\n\\n\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings.  \"What is the gentleman\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"I must not tell, ma\\'am. But I know very well what it is;\\nand I know where he is too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house\\nat Norland to be sure.  He is the curate of the parish\\nI dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.\"\\n\\n\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth,\\n\"you know that all this is an invention of your own,\\nand that there is no such person in existence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I\\nam sure there was such a man once, and his name begins\\nwith an F.\"\\n\\nMost grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton\\nfor observing, at this moment, \"that it rained very hard,\"\\nthough she believed the interruption to proceed less from\\nany attention to her, than from her ladyship\\'s great dislike\\nof all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\\nher husband and mother.  The idea however started by her,\\nwas immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was\\non every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;\\nand much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.\\nWilloughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne\\nto sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours\\nof different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.\\nBut not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into\\nwhich it had thrown her.\\n\\nA party was formed this evening for going on the\\nfollowing day to see a very fine place about twelve miles\\nfrom Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon,\\nwithout whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor,\\nwho was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.\\nThe grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\\nand Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,\\nmight be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had\\nformed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer\\nfor the last ten years.  They contained a noble piece\\nof water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of\\nthe morning\\'s amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,\\nopen carriages only to be employed, and every thing\\nconducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\\n\\nTo some few of the company it appeared rather\\na bold undertaking, considering the time of year,\\nand that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--\\nand Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded\\nby Elinor to stay at home.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\n\\nTheir intended excursion to Whitwell turned out\\nvery different from what Elinor had expected.  She was\\nprepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened;\\nbut the event was still more unfortunate, for they did\\nnot go at all.\\n\\nBy ten o\\'clock the whole party was assembled at\\nthe park, where they were to breakfast.  The morning\\nwas rather favourable, though it had rained all night,\\nas the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\\nand the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high\\nspirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined\\nto submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships\\nrather than be otherwise.\\n\\nWhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.\\nAmong the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he\\ntook it, looked at the direction, changed colour,\\nand immediately left the room.\\n\\n\"What is the matter with Brandon?\" said Sir John.\\n\\nNobody could tell.\\n\\n\"I hope he has had no bad news,\" said Lady Middleton.\\n\"It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel\\nBrandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly.\"\\n\\nIn about five minutes he returned.\\n\\n\"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nas soon as he entered the room.\\n\\n\"None at all, ma\\'am, I thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say\\nthat your sister is worse.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am. It came from town, and is merely\\na letter of business.\"\\n\\n\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much,\\nif it was only a letter of business?  Come, come,\\nthis won\\'t do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.\"\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" said Lady Middleton, \"recollect what\\nyou are saying.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny\\nis married?\" said Mrs. Jennings, without attending\\nto her daughter\\'s reproof.\\n\\n\"No, indeed, it is not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I\\nhope she is well.\"\\n\\n\"Whom do you mean, ma\\'am?\" said he, colouring a little.\\n\\n\"Oh! you know who I mean.\"\\n\\n\"I am particularly sorry, ma\\'am,\" said he,\\naddressing Lady Middleton, \"that I should receive this\\nletter today, for it is on business which requires\\nmy immediate attendance in town.\"\\n\\n\"In town!\" cried Mrs. Jennings.  \"What can you\\nhave to do in town at this time of year?\"\\n\\n\"My own loss is great,\" be continued, \"in being obliged\\nto leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned,\\nas I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance\\nat Whitwell.\"\\n\\nWhat a blow upon them all was this!\\n\\n\"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,\"\\nsaid Marianne, eagerly, \"will it not be sufficient?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\"We must go,\" said Sir John.--\"It shall not be put\\noff when we are so near it.  You cannot go to town till\\ntomorrow, Brandon, that is all.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it\\nis not in my power to delay my journey for one day!\"\\n\\n\"If you would but let us know what your business is,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings, \"we might see whether it could be put\\noff or not.\"\\n\\n\"You would not be six hours later,\" said Willoughby,\\n\"if you were to defer your journey till our return.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.\"--\\n\\nElinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne,\\n\"There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.\\nBrandon is one of them.  He was afraid of catching cold\\nI dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it.\\nI would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" replied Marianne.\\n\\n\"There is no persuading you to change your mind,\\nBrandon, I know of old,\" said Sir John, \"when once you\\nare determined on anything.  But, however, I hope you\\nwill think better of it.  Consider, here are the two Miss\\nCareys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods\\nwalked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up\\ntwo hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.\"\\n\\nColonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being\\nthe cause of disappointing the party; but at the same\\ntime declared it to be unavoidable.\\n\\n\"Well, then, when will you come back again?\"\\n\\n\"I hope we shall see you at Barton,\" added her ladyship,\\n\"as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must\\nput off the party to Whitwell till you return.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain,\\nwhen I may have it in my power to return, that I dare\\nnot engage for it at all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! he must and shall come back,\" cried Sir John.\\n\"If he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go\\nafter him.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, so do, Sir John,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"and then\\nperhaps you may find out what his business is.\"\\n\\n\"I do not want to pry into other men\\'s concerns.\\nI suppose it is something he is ashamed of.\"\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s horses were announced.\\n\\n\"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?\"\\nadded Sir John.\\n\\n\"No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you\\na good journey.  But you had better change your mind.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you it is not in my power.\"\\n\\nHe then took leave of the whole party.\\n\\n\"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters\\nin town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid, none at all.\"\\n\\n\"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time\\nthan I should wish to do.\"\\n\\nTo Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Come Colonel,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"before you go,\\ndo let us know what you are going about.\"\\n\\nHe wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John,\\nleft the room.\\n\\nThe complaints and lamentations which politeness\\nhad hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally;\\nand they all agreed again and again how provoking it was\\nto be so disappointed.\\n\\n\"I can guess what his business is, however,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings exultingly.\\n\\n\"Can you, ma\\'am?\" said almost every body.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"And who is Miss Williams?\" asked Marianne.\\n\\n\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am\\nsure you must have heard of her before.  She is a relation\\nof the Colonel\\'s, my dear; a very near relation.  We will\\nnot say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.\"\\nThen, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\\n\"She is his natural daughter.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.\\nI dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune.\"\\n\\nWhen Sir John returned, he joined most heartily\\nin the general regret on so unfortunate an event;\\nconcluding however by observing, that as they were\\nall got together, they must do something by way of\\nbeing happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,\\nthat although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell,\\nthey might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\\nabout the country.  The carriages were then ordered;\\nWilloughby\\'s was first, and Marianne never looked\\nhappier than when she got into it.  He drove through\\nthe park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;\\nand nothing more of them was seen till their return,\\nwhich did not happen till after the return of all the rest.\\nThey both seemed delighted with their drive; but said\\nonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,\\nwhile the others went on the downs.\\n\\nIt was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,\\nand that every body should be extremely merry all day long.\\nSome more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the\\npleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir\\nJohn observed with great contentment.  Willoughby took\\nhis usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\\nMrs. Jennings sat on Elinor\\'s right hand; and they had not\\nbeen long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby,\\nand said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,\\n\"I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.\\nI know where you spent the morning.\"\\n\\nMarianne coloured, and replied very hastily,\\n\"Where, pray?\"--\\n\\n\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had\\nbeen out in my curricle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well,\\nand I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.--\\nI hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.  It is a very\\nlarge one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you\\nwill have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much\\nwhen I was there six years ago.\"\\n\\nMarianne turned away in great confusion.\\nMrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her\\nresolution to know where they had been, she had actually\\nmade her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby\\'s groom;\\nand that she had by that method been informed that they\\nhad gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there\\nin walking about the garden and going all over the house.\\n\\nElinor could hardly believe this to be true,\\nas it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,\\nor Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was\\nin it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.\\n\\nAs soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired\\nof her about it; and great was her surprise when she\\nfound that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings\\nwas perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry with her\\nfor doubting it.\\n\\n\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not\\ngo there, or that we did not see the house?  Is not it\\nwhat you have often wished to do yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith\\nwas there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can\\nhave a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open\\ncarriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.\\nI never spent a pleasanter morning in my life.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness\\nof an employment does not always evince its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof\\nof it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety\\nin what I did, I should have been sensible of it at\\nthe time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,\\nand with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you\\nto some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin\\nto doubt the discretion of your own conduct?\"\\n\\n\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are\\nto be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all\\noffending every moment of our lives.  I value not her\\ncensure any more than I should do her commendation.\\nI am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\\nover Mrs. Smith\\'s grounds, or in seeing her house.\\nThey will one day be Mr. Willoughby\\'s, and--\"\\n\\n\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,\\nyou would not be justified in what you have done.\"\\n\\nShe blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly\\ngratifying to her; and after a ten minutes\\' interval of\\nearnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said\\nwith great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather\\nill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted\\nparticularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,\\nI assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room\\nup stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,\\nand with modern furniture it would be delightful.\\nIt is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.\\nOn one side you look across the bowling-green, behind\\nthe house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you\\nhave a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,\\nof those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.\\nI did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be\\nmore forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly\\nfitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,\\nwould make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms\\nin England.\"\\n\\nCould Elinor have listened to her without interruption\\nfrom the others, she would have described every room\\nin the house with equal delight.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\n\\nThe sudden termination of Colonel Brandon\\'s visit\\nat the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,\\nfilled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings\\nfor two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every\\none must be who takes a very lively interest in all the\\ncomings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered,\\nwith little intermission what could be the reason of it;\\nwas sure there must be some bad news, and thought over\\nevery kind of distress that could have befallen him,\\nwith a fixed determination that he should not escape\\nthem all.\\n\\n\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,\\nI am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face.\\nPoor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.\\nThe estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\\na year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.\\nI do think he must have been sent for about money matters,\\nfor what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.\\nI would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it\\nis about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,\\nbecause he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\\nMay be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,\\nfor I have a notion she is always rather sickly.\\nI would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.\\nIt is not so very likely he should be distressed in\\nhis circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,\\nand to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.\\nI wonder what it can be!  May be his sister is worse\\nat Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off\\nin such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out\\nof all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into\\nthe bargain.\"\\n\\nSo wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion\\nvarying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming\\nequally probable as they arose.  Elinor, though she felt\\nreally interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,\\ncould not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\naway, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;\\nfor besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\\njustify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,\\nher wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was engrossed\\nby the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby\\non the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly\\ninteresting to them all.  As this silence continued,\\nevery day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\\nwith the disposition of both.  Why they should not openly\\nacknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\\nbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place,\\nElinor could not imagine.\\n\\nShe could easily conceive that marriage might not\\nbe immediately in their power; for though Willoughby\\nwas independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.\\nHis estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven\\nhundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income\\ncould hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\\nof his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy\\nmaintained by them relative to their engagement, which\\nin fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;\\nand it was so wholly contradictory to their general\\nopinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\\nher mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt\\nwas enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\\n\\nNothing could be more expressive of attachment\\nto them all, than Willoughby\\'s behaviour.  To Marianne\\nit had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover\\'s\\nheart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the\\naffectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The cottage\\nseemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;\\nmany more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;\\nand if no general engagement collected them at the park,\\nthe exercise which called him out in the morning was\\nalmost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day\\nwas spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet.\\n\\nOne evening in particular, about a week after\\nColonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed\\nmore than usually open to every feeling of attachment\\nto the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood\\'s\\nhappening to mention her design of improving the cottage\\nin the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration\\nof a place which affection had established as perfect with him.\\n\\n\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!\\nNo. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must\\nbe added to its walls, not an inch to its size,\\nif my feelings are regarded.\"\\n\\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood,\\n\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother\\nwill never have money enough to attempt it.\"\\n\\n\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"May she\\nalways be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I\\nwould not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\\nof yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements\\nin the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed\\nsum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,\\nI would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\\nof it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really\\nso attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he.  \"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,\\nI consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\\nis attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull\\nCombe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this\\ncottage.\"\\n\\n\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,\\nI suppose,\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all\\nand every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience\\nor INconvenience about it, should the least variation\\nbe perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I\\nmight perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"\\n\\n\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under\\nthe disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,\\nyou will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\\nnow do this.\"\\n\\n\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby,\\n\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will\\nalways have one claim of my affection, which no other can\\npossibly share.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,\\nwhose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,\\nas plainly denoted how well she understood him.\\n\\n\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at\\nAllenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were\\ninhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring\\nits situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.\\nHow little did I then think that the very first news\\nI should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into\\nthe country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I\\nfelt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,\\nwhich nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I\\nshould experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have\\nbeen so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.\\nThen continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this\\nhouse you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it\\nof its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear\\nparlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which\\nso many happy hours have been since spent by us together,\\nyou would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room\\nwhich has hitherto contained within itself more real\\naccommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\\nthe handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration\\nof the kind should be attempted.\\n\\n\"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.\\n\"Your promise makes me easy.  Extend it a little farther,\\nand it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your\\nhouse will remain the same, but that I shall ever find\\nyou and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you\\nwill always consider me with the kindness which has made\\neverything belonging to you so dear to me.\"\\n\\nThe promise was readily given, and Willoughby\\'s\\nbehaviour during the whole of the evening declared\\nat once his affection and happiness.\\n\\n\"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\\nwhen he was leaving them.  \"I do not ask you to come in\\nthe morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady\\nMiddleton.\"\\n\\nHe engaged to be with them by four o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood\\'s visit to Lady Middleton took place\\nthe next day, and two of her daughters went with her;\\nbut Marianne excused herself from being of the party,\\nunder some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,\\nwho concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby\\nthe night before of calling on her while they were absent,\\nwas perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.\\n\\nOn their return from the park they found Willoughby\\'s\\ncurricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,\\nand Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture\\nhad been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;\\nbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\\nhad taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in the\\npassage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour\\napparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief\\nat her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\\nSurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\\nshe had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,\\nwho was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back\\ntowards them.  He turned round on their coming in,\\nand his countenance shewed that he strongly partook\\nof the emotion which over-powered Marianne.\\n\\n\"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood\\nas she entered--\"is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;\\nand with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may\\nrather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a\\nvery heavy disappointment!\"\\n\\n\"Disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.\\nMrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege\\nof riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on\\nbusiness to London.  I have just received my dispatches,\\nand taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration\\nI am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\\n\\n\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Almost this moment.\"\\n\\n\"This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must\\nbe obliged;--and her business will not detain you from\\nus long I hope.\"\\n\\nHe coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I\\nhave no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately.\\nMy visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within\\nthe twelvemonth.\"\\n\\n\"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only\\nhouse in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?\\nFor shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"\\n\\nHis colour increased; and with his eyes fixed\\non the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.\\nElinor felt equal amazement.  For a few moments every one\\nwas silent.  Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.\\n\\n\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at\\nBarton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not\\npress you to return here immediately, because you only\\ncan judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;\\nand on this head I shall be no more disposed to question\\nyour judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\\n\\n\"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby,\\nconfusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter\\nmyself\"--\\n\\nHe stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished\\nto speak, and another pause succeeded.  This was broken\\nby Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly\\nto linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself\\nany longer by remaining among friends whose society\\nit is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\\n\\nHe then hastily took leave of them all and left\\nthe room.  They saw him step into his carriage,\\nand in a minute it was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly\\nquitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\\nand alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.\\n\\nElinor\\'s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother\\'s.\\nShe thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.\\nWilloughby\\'s behaviour in taking leave of them, his\\nembarrassment,\\nand affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his\\nunwillingness\\nto accept her mother\\'s invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\\nlover,\\nso unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared\\nthat no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the\\nnext that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\\nand\\nher sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room\\nwas such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,\\nthough when she considered what Marianne\\'s love for him was,\\na quarrel seemed almost impossible.\\n\\nBut whatever might be the particulars of their separation,\\nher sister\\'s affliction was indubitable; and she thought\\nwith the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\\nwhich Marianne was in all probability not merely giving\\nway to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.\\n\\nIn about half an hour her mother returned, and though\\nher eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\\n\\n\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\"\\nsaid she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart\\ndoes he travel?\"\\n\\n\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It\\nseems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was\\nwith us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now,\\nafter only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending\\nto return!--Something more than what be owned to us must\\nhave happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave\\nlike himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.\\nWhat can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he\\nhave shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--\\n\\n\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could\\nplainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.\\nI have thought it all over I assure you, and I can\\nperfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\\nstrange to me as well as to you.\"\\n\\n\"Can you, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most\\nsatisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt\\nwhere you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you\\nshall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded\\nthat Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\\ndisapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views\\nfor him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--\\nand that the business which she sends him off to transact\\nis invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I\\nbelieve to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she\\nDOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore\\nat present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,\\nand he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,\\nto give into her schemes, and absent himself from\\nDevonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,\\nthat this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen\\nto no cavil, unless you can point out any other method\\nof understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.\\nAnd now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not\\nhave happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your\\nfeelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.\\nYou had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt\\nfor poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.\\nYou are resolved to think him blameable, because he took\\nleave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\\nhas shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,\\nor for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are\\nno probabilities to be accepted, merely because they\\nare not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we\\nhave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world\\nto think ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable\\nin themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,\\nafter all, what is it you suspect him of?\"\\n\\n\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of\\nsomething unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\\nof such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.\\nThere is great truth, however, in what you have now urged\\nof the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it\\nis my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.\\nWilloughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\\nreasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\\nBut it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge\\nthem at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I\\ncannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"\\n\\n\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from\\nhis character, where the deviation is necessary.\\nBut you really do admit the justice of what I have said\\nin his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\\n\\n\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their\\nengagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--\\nand if that is the case, it must be highly expedient\\nfor Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.\\nBut this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\\n\\n\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse\\nWilloughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange\\nindeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day\\nfor incautiousness.\"\\n\\n\"I want no proof of their affection,\" said Elinor;\\n\"but of their engagement I do.\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied of both.\"\\n\\n\"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the\\nsubject, by either of them.\"\\n\\n\"I have not wanted syllables where actions have\\nspoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne\\nand to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,\\ndeclared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,\\nand that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\\nrelation?  Have we not perfectly understood each other?\\nHas not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,\\nhis attentive and affectionate respect?  My Elinor,\\nis it possible to doubt their engagement?  How could\\nsuch a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed\\nthat Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your\\nsister\\'s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps\\nfor months, without telling her of his affection;--that\\nthey should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"\\n\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance\\nexcept ONE is in favour of their engagement;\\nbut that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,\\nand with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\\n\\n\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed\\nof Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,\\nyou can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.\\nHas he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\\nall this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"\\n\\n\"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\n\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can\\nleave her with such indifference, such carelessness\\nof the future, as you attribute to him.\"\\n\\n\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never\\nconsidered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,\\nI confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they\\nmay soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond,\\nevery fear of mine will be removed.\"\\n\\n\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see\\nthem at the altar, you would suppose they were going to\\nbe married.  Ungracious girl!  But I require no such proof.\\nNothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;\\nno secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open\\nand unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister\\'s wishes.\\nIt must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?\\nIs he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any\\ninconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, I believe not,\" cried Elinor.\\n\"I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his\\nintegrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.\\nIt has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.\\nI was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,\\nand did not return your kindness with any cordiality.\\nBut all this may be explained by such a situation of his\\naffairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted from\\nmy sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;\\nand if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,\\nto resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet\\naware that by declining your invitation, by saying\\nthat he was going away for some time, he should seem\\nto act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,\\nbe might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,\\na plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\\nmore to his honour I think, as well as more consistent\\nwith his general character;--but I will not raise objections\\nagainst any one\\'s conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\\nas a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from\\nwhat I may think right and consistent.\"\\n\\n\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does\\nnot deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known\\nhim long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;\\nand who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  Had he been\\nin a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without\\nacknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.\\nIt is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,\\nfor their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;\\nand even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now\\nbe very advisable.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret;\\nand Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations\\nof her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,\\nand hope for the justice of all.\\n\\nThey saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time,\\nwhen she entered the room and took her place at the table\\nwithout saying a word.  Her eyes were red and swollen;\\nand it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained\\nwith difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,\\ncould neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her\\nmother\\'s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,\\nher small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst\\ninto tears and left the room.\\n\\nThis violent oppression of spirits continued the\\nwhole evening.  She was without any power, because she\\nwas without any desire of command over herself.\\nThe slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant; and though her family\\nwere most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was\\nimpossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear\\nof every subject which her feelings connected with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\n\\nMarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable\\nhad she been able to sleep at all the first night\\nafter parting from Willoughby.  She would have been\\nashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,\\nhad she not risen from her bed in more need of repose\\nthan when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which\\nmade such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger\\nof incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she\\nwept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,\\nwas unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,\\nand forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.\\nHer sensibility was potent enough!\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself,\\nand wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the\\nrecollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present\\nreverse for the chief of the morning.\\n\\nThe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.\\nShe played over every favourite song that she had been used\\nto play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices\\nhad been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing\\non every line of music that he had written out for her,\\ntill her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\\ncould be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every\\nday applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte\\nalternately singing and crying; her voice often totally\\nsuspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music,\\nshe courted the misery which a contrast between the past\\nand present was certain of giving.  She read nothing\\nbut what they had been used to read together.\\n\\nSuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported\\nfor ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;\\nbut these employments, to which she daily recurred,\\nher solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced\\noccasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.\\n\\nNo letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected\\nby Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again\\nbecame uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations\\nwhenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.\\n\\n\"Remember, Elinor,\" said she, \"how very often Sir John\\nfetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them\\nto it.  We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,\\nand we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if\\ntheir correspondence were to pass through Sir John\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nElinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried\\nto find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.\\nBut there was one method so direct, so simple, and in\\nher opinion so eligible of knowing the real state\\nof the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,\\nthat she could not help suggesting it to her mother.\\n\\n\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she,\\n\"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you,\\nher mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question\\ncould not give offence.  It would be the natural result\\nof your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve,\\nand to you more especially.\"\\n\\n\"I would not ask such a question for the world.\\nSupposing it possible that they are not engaged,\\nwhat distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any\\nrate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve\\nher confidence again, after forcing from her a confession\\nof what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.\\nI know Marianne\\'s heart: I know that she dearly loves me,\\nand that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\\nknown,\\nwhen circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.\\nI would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;\\nof a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent\\nthe denial which her wishes might direct.\"\\n\\nElinor thought this generosity overstrained,\\nconsidering her sister\\'s youth, and urged the matter farther,\\nbut in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,\\nwere all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s romantic delicacy.\\n\\nIt was several days before Willoughby\\'s name\\nwas mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;\\nSir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;\\ntheir witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--\\nbut one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a\\nvolume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,\\n\\n\"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear\\nWilloughby went away before we could get through it.\\nWe will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may\\nbe months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"\\n\\n\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.\\n\"No--nor many weeks.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;\\nbut it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply\\nfrom Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby\\nand knowledge of his intentions.\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after his leaving the country,\\nMarianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\\nusual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.\\nHitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\\nher rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked\\nof the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,\\nand could never be found when the others set off.\\nBut at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,\\nwho greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  They walked\\nalong the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\\nfor Marianne\\'s MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,\\nsatisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.\\nBeyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,\\nthough still rich, was less wild and more open, a long\\nstretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\\nto Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\\nthey stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage,\\nfrom a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\\nof their walks before.\\n\\nAmongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered\\nan animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.\\nIn a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;\\nand in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,\\n\\n\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was\\nhastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,\\n\\n\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is\\nnot Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,\\nand has not his air.\"\\n\\n\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.\\nHis air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"\\n\\nShe walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,\\nto screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost\\ncertain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her\\npace and kept up with her.  They were soon within\\nthirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again;\\nher heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,\\nshe was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters\\nwere raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known\\nas Willoughby\\'s, joined them in begging her to stop,\\nand she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\nEdward Ferrars.\\n\\nHe was the only person in the world who could\\nat that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;\\nthe only one who could have gained a smile from her;\\nbut she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her\\nsister\\'s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\\n\\nHe dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,\\nwalked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely\\ncoming to visit them.\\n\\nHe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,\\nbut especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of\\nregard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.\\nTo Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister\\nwas but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\\nhad often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.\\nOn Edward\\'s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.\\nHe was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\\nin seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,\\nsaid little but what was forced from him by questions,\\nand distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.\\nMarianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.\\nShe began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,\\nas every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her\\nthoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast\\nsufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\\n\\nAfter a short silence which succeeded the first\\nsurprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked\\nEdward if he came directly from London.  No, he had\\nbeen in Devonshire a fortnight.\\n\\n\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being\\nso long in the same county with Elinor without seeing\\nher before.\\n\\nHe looked rather distressed as he added, that he\\nhad been staying with some friends near Plymouth.\\n\\n\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks\\nmuch as it always does at this time of the year.\\nThe woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation\\nhave I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted,\\nas I walked, to see them driven in showers about me\\nby the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air\\naltogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.\\nThey are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,\\nand driven as much as possible from the sight.\"\\n\\n\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your\\npassion for dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often\\nunderstood.  But SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this,\\nshe sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing\\nherself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she, calling his attention\\nto the prospect, \"here is Barton valley.  Look up to it,\\nand be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!\\nDid you ever see their equals?  To the left is Barton park,\\namongst those woods and plantations.  You may see the end\\nof the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill,\\nwhich rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\\n\\n\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these\\nbottoms must be dirty in winter.\"\\n\\n\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the\\nobjects before me, I see a very dirty lane.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\\n\\n\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the\\nMiddletons pleasant people?\"\\n\\n\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not\\nbe more unfortunately situated.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can\\nyou be so unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr.\\nFerrars;\\nand towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you\\nforgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many\\npainful moments.\"\\n\\nElinor took no notice of this; and directing\\nher attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support\\nsomething like discourse with him, by talking of their\\npresent residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him\\noccasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;\\nbut resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\\nrather than the present, she avoided every appearance\\nof resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she\\nthought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at\\nseeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,\\nof all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression\\nof regard long outlived her wonder.  He received the kindest\\nwelcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him\\nbefore he entered the house, and they were quite overcome\\nby the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man\\ncould not very well be in love with either of her daughters,\\nwithout extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the\\nsatisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.\\nHis affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,\\nand his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.\\nHe was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,\\nadmired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still\\nhe was not in spirits.  The whole family perceived it,\\nand Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality\\nin his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents.\\n\\n\"What are Mrs. Ferrars\\'s views for you at present, Edward?\"\\nsaid she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round\\nthe fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have\\nno more talents than inclination for a public life!\"\\n\\n\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you\\nmust be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination\\nfor expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,\\nand no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be\\ndistinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.\\nThank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.\"\\n\\n\"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes\\nare all moderate.\"\\n\\n\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world,\\nI believe.  I wish as well as every body else to be\\nperfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be\\nin my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"\\n\\n\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.  \"What have\\nwealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"\\n\\n\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth\\nhas much to do with it.\"\\n\\n\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only\\ngive happiness where there is nothing else to give it.\\nBeyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,\\nas far as mere self is concerned.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come\\nto the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth\\nare very much alike, I dare say; and without them,\\nas the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas\\nare only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"\\n\\n\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;\\nnot more than THAT.\"\\n\\nElinor laughed.  \"TWO thousand a year! ONE is my\\nwealth! I guessed how it would end.\"\\n\\n\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\"\\nsaid Marianne.  \"A family cannot well be maintained on\\na smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.\\nA proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,\\nand hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"\\n\\nElinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing\\nso accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.\\n\\n\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have\\nhunters?  Every body does not hunt.\"\\n\\nMarianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought,\\n\"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"\\n\\n\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes\\nsparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing\\nwith the delight of such imaginary happiness.\\n\\n\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be!\\nI wonder what I should do with it!\"\\n\\nMarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\\n\\n\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich\\nmy help.\"\\n\\n\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\"\\nobserved Elinor, \"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\\n\\n\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family\\nto London,\" said Edward, \"in such an event!  What a happy\\nday for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  You,\\nMiss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every\\nnew print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,\\nI know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough\\nin London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\\nScott--she would buy them all over and over again: she\\nwould buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their\\nfalling into unworthy hands; and she would have every\\nbook that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\\nShould not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very saucy.\\nBut I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our\\nold disputes.\"\\n\\n\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it\\nbe melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you\\nwill never offend me by talking of former times.\\nYou are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly\\nbe employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\\n\\n\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\\nin annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"\\n\\n\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do\\nwith it.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that\\nperson who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,\\nthat no one can ever be in love more than once in their\\nlife--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.\\nIt is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to\\nchange them.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor,\\n\"she is not at all altered.\"\\n\\n\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me.\\nYou are not very gay yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.\\n\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"\\n\\n\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne\\'s,\" said Elinor;\\n\"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,\\nvery eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal\\nand always with animation--but she is not often really merry.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I\\nhave always set her down as a lively girl.\"\\n\\n\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some\\npoint or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,\\nor ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can\\nhardly tell why or in what the deception originated.\\nSometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,\\nand very frequently by what other people say of them,\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\\n\\n\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne,\\n\"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.\\nI thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\\nto those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\n\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed\\nat the subjection of the understanding.  All I have\\never attempted to influence has been the behaviour.\\nYou must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\\nin general with greater attention; but when have I advised\\nyou to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\\njudgment in serious matters?\"\\n\\n\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your\\nplan of general civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain\\nno ground?\"\\n\\n\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor,\\nlooking expressively at Marianne.\\n\\n\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side\\nof the question; but I am afraid my practice is much\\nmore on your sister\\'s.  I never wish to offend, but I\\nam so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,\\nwhen I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.\\nI have frequently thought that I must have been intended\\nby nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at\\nmy ease among strangers of gentility!\"\\n\\n\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention\\nof hers,\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\"\\nreplied Edward.  \"Shyness is only the effect of a sense\\nof inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade\\nmyself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,\\nI should not be shy.\"\\n\\n\"But you would still be reserved,\" said Marianne,\\n\"and that is worse.\"\\n\\nEdward started--\"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring.\\n\"Reserved!--how, in what manner?  What am I to tell you?\\nWhat can you suppose?\"\\n\\nElinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying\\nto laugh off the subject, she said to him, \"Do not you\\nknow my sister well enough to understand what she means?\\nDo not you know she calls every one reserved who does not\\ntalk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously\\nas herself?\"\\n\\nEdward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness\\nreturned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat\\nfor some time silent and dull.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\n\\nElinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits\\nof her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very\\npartial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it\\nappeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;\\nshe wished it were equally evident that he still\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once\\nshe had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the\\ncontinuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;\\nand the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\\none moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding\\none.\\n\\nHe joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room\\nthe next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,\\nwho was always eager to promote their happiness as far\\nas she could, soon left them to themselves.  But before she\\nwas half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,\\nturning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.\\n\\n\"I am going into the village to see my horses,\"\\nsaid be, \"as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall\\nbe back again presently.\"\\n\\n                    ***\\n\\nEdward returned to them with fresh admiration\\nof the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,\\nhe had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;\\nand the village itself, in a much higher situation than\\nthe cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\\nexceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured\\nMarianne\\'s attention, and she was beginning to describe\\nher own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more\\nminutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,\\nwhen Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not\\nenquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge\\nin the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call\\nhills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange\\nand uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;\\nand distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\\nYou must be satisfied with such admiration as I can\\nhonestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the\\nhills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\\nand the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\\nand there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,\\nbecause it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it\\nis a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can\\neasily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,\\ngrey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\\nI know nothing of the picturesque.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid it is but too true,\" said Marianne;\\n\"but why should you boast of it?\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind\\nof affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he\\nbelieves many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\\nof nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with\\nsuch pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less\\ndiscrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.\\nHe is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration\\nof landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.\\nEvery body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\\nthe taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,\\nand sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,\\nbecause I could find no language to describe them\\nin but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"\\n\\n\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel\\nall the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\\nto feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me\\nto feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,\\nbut not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,\\ntwisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they\\nare tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,\\ntattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,\\nor heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug\\nfarm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,\\nhappy villages please me better than the finest banditti\\nin the world.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked with amazement at Edward,\\nwith compassion at her sister.  Elinor only laughed.\\n\\nThe subject was continued no farther; and Marianne\\nremained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly\\nengaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and\\nin taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed\\nso directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\\nof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\\n\\n\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried.\\n\"Is that Fanny\\'s hair? I remember her promising to give\\nyou some.  But I should have thought her hair had been darker.\"\\n\\nMarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--\\nbut when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own\\nvexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\\nby his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary\\nglance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister\\'s hair.\\nThe setting always casts a different shade on it,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nElinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.\\nThat the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as\\nwell satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their\\nconclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free\\ngift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been\\nprocured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\\nShe was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,\\nand affecting to take no notice of what passed,\\nby instantly talking of something else, she internally\\nresolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\\nthe hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,\\nthat it was exactly the shade of her own.\\n\\nEdward\\'s embarrassment lasted some time, and it\\nended in an absence of mind still more settled.\\nHe was particularly grave the whole morning.\\nMarianne severely censured herself for what she had said;\\nbut her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,\\nhad she known how little offence it had given her sister.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir\\nJohn and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival\\nof a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey\\nof the guest.  With the assistance of his mother-in-law,\\nSir John was not long in discovering that the name of\\nFerrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine\\nof raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but\\nthe newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have\\nprevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,\\nshe only learned, from some very significant looks, how far\\ntheir penetration, founded on Margaret\\'s instructions, extended.\\n\\nSir John never came to the Dashwoods without either\\ninviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink\\ntea with them that evening.  On the present occasion,\\nfor the better entertainment of their visitor, towards\\nwhose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,\\nhe wished to engage them for both.\\n\\n\"You MUST drink tea with us to night,\" said he,\\n\"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must\\nabsolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  \"And who knows\\nbut you may raise a dance,\" said she.  \"And that will\\ntempt YOU, Miss Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"A dance!\" cried Marianne.  \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\"\\n\\n\"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers\\nto be sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance\\nbecause a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!\"\\n\\n\"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John,\\n\"that Willoughby were among us again.\"\\n\\nThis, and Marianne\\'s blushing, gave new suspicions\\nto Edward.  \"And who is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice,\\nto Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.\\n\\nShe gave him a brief reply.  Marianne\\'s countenance\\nwas more communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend,\\nnot only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne\\'s\\nexpressions as had puzzled him before; and when their\\nvisitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,\\nin a whisper, \"I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you\\nmy guess?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\"\\n\\nMarianne was surprised and confused, yet she could\\nnot help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,\\nand after a moment\\'s silence, said,\\n\\n\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come\\nI hope...I am sure you will like him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished\\nat her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it\\nto be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,\\nfounded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby\\nand herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\n\\nEdward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly\\npressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he\\nwere bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved\\nto be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\\nthe height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,\\nthough still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew\\nmore and more partial to the house and environs--never\\nspoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time\\nto be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he\\nshould go when he left them--but still, go he must.\\nNever had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly\\nbelieve it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other things\\nhe said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave\\nthe lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland;\\nhe detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,\\nhe must go.  He valued their kindness beyond any thing,\\nand his greatest happiness was in being with them.\\nYet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite\\nof their wishes and his own, and without any restraint\\non his time.\\n\\nElinor placed all that was astonishing in this\\nway of acting to his mother\\'s account; and it was\\nhappy for her that he had a mother whose character\\nwas so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general\\nexcuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.\\nDisappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes\\ndispleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,\\nshe was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\\nwith all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\\nwhich had been rather more painfully extorted from her,\\nfor Willoughby\\'s service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,\\nof openness, and of consistency, were most usually\\nattributed to his want of independence, and his better\\nknowledge of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s disposition and designs.\\nThe shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\\nin leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,\\nthe same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.\\nThe old well-established grievance of duty against will,\\nparent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have\\nbeen glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,\\nthis opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would\\nbe reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.\\nBut from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\\nto the renewal of her confidence in Edward\\'s affection,\\nto the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\\nwhich fell from him while at Barton, and above all\\nto that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\\nround his finger.\\n\\n\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were\\nat breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man\\nif you had any profession to engage your time and give\\nan interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience\\nto your friends, indeed, might result from it--you\\nwould not be able to give them so much of your time.\\nBut (with a smile) you would be materially benefited\\nin one particular at least--you would know where to go\\nwhen you left them.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long\\nthought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,\\nand is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\\nto me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,\\nno profession to give me employment, or afford me any\\nthing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety,\\nand the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,\\nan idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our\\nchoice of a profession.  I always preferred the church,\\nas I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.\\nThey recommended the army.  That was a great deal\\ntoo smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel\\nenough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,\\nmade a very good appearance in the first circles,\\nand drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had\\nno inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse\\nstudy of it, which my family approved.  As for the navy,\\nit had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\\nsubject was first started to enter it--and, at length,\\nas there was no necessity for my having any profession\\nat all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without\\na red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced\\non the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,\\nand a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\\nfriends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford\\nand have been properly idle ever since.\"\\n\\n\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted\\nyour own happiness, that your sons will be brought up\\nto as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\\nas Columella\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,\\n\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling,\\nin action, in condition, in every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate\\nwant of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,\\nand fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.\\nBut remember that the pain of parting from friends\\nwill be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\\neducation or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want\\nnothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,\\ncall it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time,\\nthat independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,\\nand it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\\nprevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\\nHow much may not a few months do?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many\\nmonths to produce any good to me.\"\\n\\nThis desponding turn of mind, though it could not\\nbe communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain\\nto them all in the parting, which shortly took place,\\nand left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor\\'s\\nfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time\\nto subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,\\nand to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\\nwhat all her family suffered on his going away, she did\\nnot adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,\\non a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,\\nby seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means\\nwere as different as their objects, and equally suited\\nto the advancement of each.\\n\\nElinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he\\nwas out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,\\nneither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,\\nappeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\\ngeneral concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,\\nshe did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters\\nwere spared much solicitude on her account.\\n\\nSuch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse\\nof her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,\\nthan her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business\\nof self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\\naffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could\\nhave no merit.  That her sister\\'s affections WERE calm,\\nshe dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;\\nand of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,\\nby still loving and respecting that sister, in spite\\nof this mortifying conviction.\\n\\nWithout shutting herself up from her family,\\nor leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,\\nor lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,\\nElinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of Edward, and of Edward\\'s behaviour, in every\\npossible variety which the different state of her spirits\\nat different times could produce,--with tenderness,\\npity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments\\nin abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother\\nand sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\\nconversation was forbidden among them, and every effect\\nof solitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitably\\nat liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;\\nand the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,\\nmust be before her, must force her attention, and engross\\nher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\\n\\nFrom a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her\\ndrawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after\\nEdward\\'s leaving them, by the arrival of company.\\nShe happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the\\nlittle gate, at the entrance of the green court in front\\nof the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw\\na large party walking up to the door.  Amongst them\\nwere Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\\nbut there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were\\nquite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,\\nand as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest\\nof the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,\\nand stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the\\ncasement to speak to him, though the space was so short\\nbetween the door and the window, as to make it hardly\\npossible to speak at one without being heard at the other.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.\\nHow do you like them?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.\\nCharlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her\\nif you look this way.\"\\n\\nAs Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\\nof minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged\\nto be excused.\\n\\n\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we\\nare come? I see her instrument is open.\"\\n\\n\"She is walking, I believe.\"\\n\\nThey were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not\\npatience enough to wait till the door was opened before\\nshe told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,\\n\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?\\nAnd where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you\\nwill be glad of a little company to sit with you.\\nI have brought my other son and daughter to see you.\\nOnly think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard\\na carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them.\\nI thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel\\nBrandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think\\nI hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come\\nback again\"--\\n\\nElinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle\\nof her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady\\nMiddleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood\\nand Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they\\nall sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings\\ncontinued her story as she walked through the passage\\ninto the parlour, attended by Sir John.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady\\nMiddleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.\\nShe was short and plump, had a very pretty face,\\nand the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant\\nas her sister\\'s, but they were much more prepossessing.\\nShe came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,\\nexcept when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.\\nHer husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\\nand twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than\\nhis wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.\\nHe entered the room with a look of self-consequence,\\nslightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,\\nand, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,\\ntook up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it\\nas long as he staid.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed\\nby nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,\\nwas hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\\nand every thing in it burst forth.\\n\\n\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never\\nsaw anything so charming!  Only think, Mamma, how it\\nis improved since I was here last! I always thought it\\nsuch a sweet place, ma\\'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\\nbut you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister,\\nhow delightful every thing is! How I should like such\\na house for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\\n\\nMr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise\\nhis eyes from the newspaper.\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;\\n\"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had\\nnever been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,\\nand could not help looking with surprise at them both.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud\\nas she could, and continued her account of their surprise,\\nthe evening before, on seeing their friends, without\\nceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer laughed\\nheartily at the recollection of their astonishment,\\nand every body agreed, two or three times over, that it\\nhad been quite an agreeable surprise.\\n\\n\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"\\nadded Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,\\nand speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\\nby no one else, though they were seated on different sides\\nof the room; \"but, however, I can\\'t help wishing they had\\nnot travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey\\nof it, for they came all round by London upon account\\nof some business, for you know (nodding significantly and\\npointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.\\nI wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,\\nbut she would come with us; she longed so much to see\\nyou all!\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her\\nany harm.\\n\\n\"She expects to be confined in February,\"\\ncontinued Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nLady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,\\nand therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there\\nwas any news in the paper.\\n\\n\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\\n\\n\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.  \"Now, Palmer,\\nyou shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"\\n\\nHe immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,\\nand ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,\\nas soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;\\nand Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,\\nas to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up\\non her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,\\nand then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer\\'s eye\\nwas now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.\\nShe got up to examine them.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!\\nDo but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;\\nI could look at them for ever.\" And then sitting down again,\\nshe very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.\\n\\nWhen Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer\\nrose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself\\nand looked at them all around.\\n\\n\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\\n\\nHe made her no answer; and only observed, after again\\nexamining the room, that it was very low pitched,\\nand that the ceiling was crooked.  He then made his bow,\\nand departed with the rest.\\n\\nSir John had been very urgent with them all to\\nspend the next day at the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did\\nnot chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\\nat the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\\nher daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no\\ncuriosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,\\nand no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.\\nThey attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;\\nthe weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.\\nBut Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should\\nbe sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too,\\nthough she did not press their mother, pressed them.\\nMrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all\\nseemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young\\nladies were obliged to yield.\\n\\n\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they\\nwere gone.  \"The rent of this cottage is said to be low;\\nbut we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine\\nat the park whenever any one is staying either with them,\\nor with us.\"\\n\\n\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by\\nthose which we received from them a few weeks ago.\\nThe alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown\\ntedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\n\\nAs the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park\\nthe next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at\\nthe other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.\\nShe took them all most affectionately by the hand,\\nand expressed great delight in seeing them again.\\n\\n\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself\\nbetween Elinor and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was\\nafraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,\\nas we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons\\ncome to us next week you know.  It was quite a sudden thing\\nour coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage\\nwas coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\\nwould go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never\\ntells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;\\nhowever we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.\"\\n\\nThey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\\n\\n\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,\\n\"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  I could\\nget the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,\\nin Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I am sure\\nI shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\\nI am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go\\ninto public.\"\\n\\nThey thanked her; but were obliged to resist all\\nher entreaties.\\n\\n\"Oh, my love,\" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband,\\nwho just then entered the room--\"you must help me to\\npersuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter.\"\\n\\nHer love made no answer; and after slightly bowing\\nto the ladies, began complaining of the weather.\\n\\n\"How horrid all this is!\" said he.  \"Such weather\\nmakes every thing and every body disgusting.  Dullness\\nis as much produced within doors as without, by rain.\\nIt makes one detest all one\\'s acquaintance.  What the\\ndevil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room\\nin his house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir\\nJohn is as stupid as the weather.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the company soon dropt in.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Miss Marianne,\" said Sir John, \"you have\\nnot been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked very grave and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer;\\n\"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your\\ntaste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome.\\nWe do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.\\nNot above ten miles, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"Much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\\n\\n\"Ah, well! there is not much difference.\\nI never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet\\npretty place.\"\\n\\n\"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,\"\\nsaid Mr. Palmer.\\n\\nMarianne remained perfectly silent, though her\\ncountenance betrayed her interest in what was said.\\n\\n\"Is it very ugly?\" continued Mrs. Palmer--\"then it\\nmust be some other place that is so pretty I suppose.\"\\n\\nWhen they were seated in the dining room, Sir John\\nobserved with regret that they were only eight all together.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking\\nthat we should be so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts\\nto come to us today?\"\\n\\n\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me\\nabout it before, that it could not be done?  They dined\\nwith us last.\"\\n\\n\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\n\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.\\n\\n\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife\\nwith her usual laugh.  \"Do you know that you are quite rude?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling\\nyour mother ill-bred.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured\\nold lady, \"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot\\ngive her back again.  So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\\n\\nCharlotte laughed heartily to think that her\\nhusband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,\\nshe did not care how cross he was to her, as they must\\nlive together.  It was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy\\nthan Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,\\nand discontent of her husband gave her no pain;\\nand when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,\\nto Elinor.  \"He is always out of humour.\"\\n\\nElinor was not inclined, after a little observation,\\nto give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\\nill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.\\nHis temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,\\nlike many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\\nwoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too\\ncommon for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--\\nIt was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,\\nwhich produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,\\nand his general abuse of every thing before him.\\nIt was the desire of appearing superior to other people.\\nThe motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,\\nhowever they might succeed by establishing his superiority\\nin ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him\\nexcept his wife.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,\\n\"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.\\nWill you come and spend some time at Cleveland this\\nChristmas?  Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are\\nwith us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!  It will\\nbe quite delightful!--My love,\" applying to her husband,\\n\"don\\'t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came\\ninto Devonshire with no other view.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer\\nexpects you; so you cannot refuse to come.\"\\n\\nThey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\\n\\n\"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you\\nwill like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,\\nand it will be quite delightful.  You cannot think\\nwhat a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,\\nfor Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election; and so many people came to dine\\nwith us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!  But,\\npoor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced\\nto make every body like him.\"\\n\\nElinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\\nassented to the hardship of such an obligation.\\n\\n\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he\\nis in Parliament!--won\\'t it? How I shall laugh!  It will\\nbe so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\\nwith an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank\\nfor me?  He declares he won\\'t.  Don\\'t you, Mr. Palmer?\"\\n\\nMr. Palmer took no notice of her.\\n\\n\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--\\n\"he says it is quite shocking.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational.\\nDon\\'t palm all your abuses of languages upon me.\"\\n\\n\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always\\nthe way with him!  Sometimes he won\\'t speak to me for half\\na day together, and then he comes out with something\\nso droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\\n\\nShe surprised Elinor very much as they returned\\ninto the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did\\nnot like Mr. Palmer excessively.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would,\\nhe is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased\\nwith you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can\\'t\\nthink how disappointed he will be if you don\\'t come\\nto Cleveland.--I can\\'t imagine why you should object\\nto it.\"\\n\\nElinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;\\nand by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.\\nShe thought it probable that as they lived in the\\nsame county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\\nmore particular account of Willoughby\\'s general\\ncharacter, than could be gathered from the Middletons\\'\\npartial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain\\nfrom any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might\\nremove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began\\nby inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\\n\\n\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\"\\nreplied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not that I ever spoke\\nto him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.\\nSomehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton\\nwhile he was at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--\\nbut I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  However, I dare say\\nwe should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,\\nif it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\\nhave been in the country together.  He is very little\\nat Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,\\nI do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is\\nin the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a\\nway off.  I know why you inquire about him, very well;\\nyour sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it,\\nfor then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much\\nmore of the matter than I do, if you have any reason\\nto expect such a match.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t pretend to deny it, because you know it is\\nwhat every body talks of.  I assure you I heard of it\\nin my way through town.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon\\nMonday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,\\nand he told me of it directly.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell\\nyou of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  To give such\\nintelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,\\neven if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel\\nBrandon to do.\"\\n\\n\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that,\\nand I will tell you how it happened.  When we met him,\\nhe turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking\\nof my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\\nand I said to him, \\'So, Colonel, there is a new family\\ncome to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word\\nthey are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be\\nmarried to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.  Is it true,\\npray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\\nDevonshire so lately.\\'\"\\n\\n\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\\n\\n\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he\\nknew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down\\nas certain.  It will be quite delightful, I declare!\\nWhen is it to take place?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,\\nhe did nothing but say fine things of you.\"\\n\\n\"I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems\\nan excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\\n\\n\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it\\nis quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.\\nMamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--\\nI assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he\\nhardly ever falls in love with any body.\"\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part\\nof Somersetshire?\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe\\nmany people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna\\nis so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable\\nI assure you.  Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby\\nwherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.\\nShe is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;\\nnot but that he is much more lucky in getting her,\\nbecause she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing\\ncan be good enough for her.  However, I don\\'t think\\nher hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;\\nfor I think you both excessively pretty, and so does\\nMr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him\\nto own it last night.\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s information respecting Willoughby\\nwas not very material; but any testimony in his favour,\\nhowever small, was pleasing to her.\\n\\n\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\"\\ncontinued Charlotte.--\"And now I hope we shall always be\\ngreat friends.  You can\\'t think how much I longed to see you!\\nIt is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!\\nNothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I am so glad\\nyour sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will\\nbe a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place,\\nby all accounts.\"\\n\\n\"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon,\\nhave not you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--\\nHe was a particular friend of Sir John\\'s. I believe,\"\\nshe added in a low voice, \"he would have been very\\nglad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John and Lady\\nMiddleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think\\nthe match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would\\nhave mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been\\nmarried immediately.\"\\n\\n\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John\\'s proposal\\nto your mother before it was made?  Had he never owned\\nhis affection to yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,\\nI dare say he would have liked it of all things.\\nHe had not seen me then above twice, for it was before\\nI left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.\\nMr. Palmer is the kind of man I like.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\n\\nThe Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day,\\nand the two families at Barton were again left to entertain\\neach other.  But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly\\ngot their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done\\nwondering at Charlotte\\'s being so happy without a cause,\\nat Mr. Palmer\\'s acting so simply, with good abilities,\\nand at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\\nhusband and wife, before Sir John\\'s and Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nactive zeal in the cause of society, procured her some\\nother new acquaintance to see and observe.\\n\\nIn a morning\\'s excursion to Exeter, they had met with\\ntwo young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction\\nof discovering to be her relations, and this was enough\\nfor Sir John to invite them directly to the park,\\nas soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\\nTheir engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before\\nsuch an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into\\nno little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing\\nthat she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\\nwhom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--\\nwhose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;\\nfor the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\\nwent for nothing at all.  Their being her relations too\\nmade it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings\\'s attempts\\nat consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,\\nwhen she advised her daughter not to care about their being\\nso fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to\\nprevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the\\nidea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,\\ncontenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\\nreprimand on the subject five or six times every day.\\n\\nThe young ladies arrived: their appearance was by\\nno means ungenteel or unfashionable.  Their dress was\\nvery smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted\\nwith the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\\nthat Lady Middleton\\'s good opinion was engaged in their\\nfavour before they had been an hour at the Park.\\nShe declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,\\nwhich for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.\\nSir John\\'s confidence in his own judgment rose with this\\nanimated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage\\nto tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles\\' arrival,\\nand to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\\nin the world.  From such commendation as this, however,\\nthere was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew\\nthat the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\\nwith in every part of England, under every possible\\nvariation of form, face, temper and understanding.\\nSir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly\\nand look at his guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It\\nwas painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.\\n\\n\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I\\ndeclare you shall come--You can\\'t think how you will\\nlike them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured\\nand agreeable!  The children are all hanging about her already,\\nas if she was an old acquaintance.  And they both long\\nto see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter\\nthat you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;\\nand I have told them it is all very true, and a great\\ndeal more.  You will be delighted with them I am sure.\\nThey have brought the whole coach full of playthings\\nfor the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?\\nWhy they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.\\nYOU are my cousins, and they are my wife\\'s, so you must\\nbe related.\"\\n\\nBut Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain\\na promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,\\nand then left them in amazement at their indifference,\\nto walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\\nMiss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss\\nSteeles to them.\\n\\nWhen their promised visit to the Park and consequent\\nintroduction to these young ladies took place, they found\\nin the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,\\nwith a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;\\nbut in the other, who was not more than two or three\\nand twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\\nfeatures were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,\\nand a smartness of air, which though it did not give\\nactual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--\\nTheir manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she\\nsaw with what constant and judicious attention they\\nwere making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.\\nWith her children they were in continual raptures,\\nextolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\\ntheir whims; and such of their time as could be spared from\\nthe importunate demands which this politeness made on it,\\nwas spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,\\nif she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns\\nof some elegant new dress, in which her appearance\\nthe day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\\nFortunately for those who pay their court through\\nsuch foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise\\nfor her children, the most rapacious of human beings,\\nis likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;\\nbut she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\\naffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards\\nher offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton\\nwithout the smallest surprise or distrust.  She saw with\\nmaternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\\nand mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\\nShe saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about\\ntheir ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives\\nand scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being\\na reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other surprise\\nthan that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing.\\n\\n\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his\\ntaking Miss Steeles\\'s pocket handkerchief, and throwing\\nit out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks.\"\\n\\nAnd soon afterwards, on the second boy\\'s violently\\npinching one of the same lady\\'s fingers, she fondly observed,\\n\"How playful William is!\"\\n\\n\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added,\\ntenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,\\nwho had not made a noise for the last two minutes;\\n\"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there\\nsuch a quiet little thing!\"\\n\\nBut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,\\na pin in her ladyship\\'s head dress slightly scratching\\nthe child\\'s neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness\\nsuch violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any\\ncreature professedly noisy.  The mother\\'s consternation\\nwas excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the\\nMiss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three,\\nin so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest\\nas likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.\\nShe was seated in her mother\\'s lap, covered with kisses,\\nher wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the\\nMiss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her,\\nand her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.\\nWith such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise\\nto cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily,\\nkicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all\\ntheir united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton\\nluckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress\\nlast week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully\\napplied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight\\nintermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it,\\ngave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--\\nShe was carried out of the room therefore in her\\nmother\\'s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the\\ntwo boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated\\nby their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies\\nwere left in a quietness which the room had not known for\\nmany hours.\\n\\n\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon\\nas they were gone.  \"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\\n\\n\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it\\nhad been under totally different circumstances.\\nBut this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there\\nis nothing to be alarmed at in reality.\"\\n\\n\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\\n\\nMarianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say\\nwhat she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;\\nand upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies\\nwhen politeness required it, always fell.  She did her\\nbest when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton\\nwith more warmth than she felt, though with far less than\\nMiss Lucy.\\n\\n\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister,\\n\"what a charming man he is!\"\\n\\nHere too, Miss Dashwood\\'s commendation, being only\\nsimple and just, came in without any eclat.  She merely\\nobserved that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.\\n\\n\"And what a charming little family they have!  I\\nnever saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I\\nquite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always\\ndistractedly fond of children.\"\\n\\n\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile,\\n\"from what I have witnessed this morning.\"\\n\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little\\nMiddletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the\\noutside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton;\\nand for my part, I love to see children full of life\\nand spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.\"\\n\\n\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at\\nBarton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children\\nwith any abhorrence.\"\\n\\nA short pause succeeded this speech, which was first\\nbroken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed\\nfor conversation, and who now said rather abruptly,\\n\"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?  I suppose\\nyou were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\\n\\nIn some surprise at the familiarity of this question,\\nor at least of the manner in which it was spoken,\\nElinor replied that she was.\\n\\n\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\"\\nadded Miss Steele.\\n\\n\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\"\\nsaid Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary\\nfor the freedom of her sister.\\n\\n\"I think every one MUST admire it,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed\\nthat any one can estimate its beauties as we do.\"\\n\\n\"And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I\\nsuppose you have not so many in this part of the world;\\nfor my part, I think they are a vast addition always.\"\\n\\n\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed\\nof her sister, \"that there are not as many genteel young\\nmen in Devonshire as Sussex?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, my dear, I\\'m sure I don\\'t pretend to say that there\\nan\\'t.  I\\'m sure there\\'s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter;\\nbut you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there\\nmight be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss\\nDashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not\\nso many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies\\nmay not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without\\nthem as with them.  For my part, I think they are vastly\\nagreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.\\nBut I can\\'t bear to see them dirty and nasty.  Now there\\'s\\nMr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\\nquite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you\\ndo but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--\\nI suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,\\nbefore he married, as he was so rich?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you,\\nfor I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.\\nBut this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before\\nhe married, he is one still for there is not the smallest\\nalteration in him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men\\'s being\\nbeaux--they have something else to do.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of\\nnothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you\\nthink of nothing else.\" And then to turn the discourse,\\nshe began admiring the house and the furniture.\\n\\nThis specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.\\nThe vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\\nher no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded\\nby the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,\\nto her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left\\nthe house without any wish of knowing them better.\\n\\nNot so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well\\nprovided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,\\nhis family, and all his relations, and no niggardly\\nproportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they\\ndeclared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,\\nand agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--\\nAnd to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found\\nwas their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely\\non the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be\\ntoo strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy\\nmust be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour\\nor two together in the same room almost every day.\\nSir John could do no more; but he did not know that any\\nmore was required: to be together was, in his opinion,\\nto be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\\nmeeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\\nestablished friends.\\n\\nTo do him justice, he did every thing in his power\\nto promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles\\nacquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins\\'\\nsituations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor\\nhad not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of\\nthem wished her joy on her sister\\'s having been so lucky\\nas to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she\\ncame to Barton.\\n\\n\"\\'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young\\nto be sure,\" said she, \"and I hear he is quite a beau,\\nand prodigious handsome.  And I hope you may have as good\\nluck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend\\nin the corner already.\"\\n\\nElinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more\\nnice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward,\\nthan he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was\\nrather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat\\nnewer and more conjectural; and since Edward\\'s visit,\\nthey had never dined together without his drinking to her\\nbest affections with so much significancy and so many nods\\nand winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--\\nhad been likewise invariably brought forward, and found\\nproductive of such countless jokes, that its character\\nas the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long\\nestablished with Elinor.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the\\nbenefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they\\nraised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman\\nalluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,\\nwas perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not\\nsport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,\\nfor he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,\\nas Miss Steele had in hearing it.\\n\\n\"His name is Ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper;\\n\"but pray do not tell it, for it\\'s a great secret.\"\\n\\n\"Ferrars!\" repeated Miss Steele; \"Mr. Ferrars is\\nthe happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law\\'s brother,\\nMiss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;\\nI know him very well.\"\\n\\n\"How can you say so, Anne?\" cried Lucy, who generally\\nmade an amendment to all her sister\\'s assertions.\\n\"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle\\'s, it\\nis rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\"\\n\\nElinor heard all this with attention and surprise.\\n\"And who was this uncle?  Where did he live?  How came\\nthey acquainted?\"  She wished very much to have the subject\\ncontinued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself;\\nbut nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\\nin her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either\\nin curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition\\nto communicate it.  The manner in which Miss Steele had\\nspoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck\\nher as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion\\nof that lady\\'s knowing, or fancying herself to know something\\nto his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing,\\nfor no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars\\'s name by\\nMiss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir\\nJohn.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\n\\nMarianne, who had never much toleration for any\\nthing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,\\nor even difference of taste from herself, was at\\nthis time particularly ill-disposed, from the state\\nof her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles,\\nor to encourage their advances; and to the invariable\\ncoldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every\\nendeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally\\nattributed that preference of herself which soon became\\nevident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy,\\nwho missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,\\nor of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy\\nand frank communication of her sentiments.\\n\\nLucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often\\njust and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour\\nElinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers\\nhad received no aid from education: she was ignorant\\nand illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\\nher want of information in the most common particulars,\\ncould not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her\\nconstant endeavour to appear to advantage.  Elinor saw,\\nand pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education\\nmight have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less\\ntenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\\nof rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,\\nher assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;\\nand she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company\\nof a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;\\nwhose want of instruction prevented their meeting\\nin conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct\\ntoward others made every shew of attention and deference\\ntowards herself perfectly valueless.\\n\\n\"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\"\\nsaid Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together\\nfrom the park to the cottage--\"but pray, are you\\npersonally acquainted with your sister-in-law\\'s mother,\\nMrs. Ferrars?\"\\n\\nElinor DID think the question a very odd one,\\nand her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she\\nhad never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I\\nthought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.\\nThen, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman\\nshe is?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real\\nopinion of Edward\\'s mother, and not very desirous\\nof satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--\\n\"I know nothing of her.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring\\nabout her in such a way,\" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively\\nas she spoke; \"but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish\\nI might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice\\nof believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.\"\\n\\nElinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on\\nfor a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,\\nwho renewed the subject again by saying, with some\\nhesitation,\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.\\nI am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be\\nthought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\\nhaving as yours.  And I am sure I should not have the smallest\\nfear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your\\nadvice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation\\nas I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.\\nI am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry I do NOT,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment,\\n\"if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.\\nBut really I never understood that you were at all connected\\nwith that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,\\nI confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all\\nwonder at it.  But if I dared tell you all, you would not be\\nso much surprised.  Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me\\nat present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come\\nmust depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately\\nconnected.\"\\n\\nShe looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,\\nwith only one side glance at her companion to observe its\\neffect on her.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean?\\nAre you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?\"\\nAnd she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such\\na sister-in-law.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I\\nnever saw him in my life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor,\\n\"to his eldest brother.\"\\n\\nWhat felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,\\nthat would have been as painful as it was strong, had not\\nan immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.\\nShe turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine\\nthe reason or object of such a declaration; and though\\nher complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,\\nand felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy;\\n\"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;\\nfor I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\\nto you or any of your family; because it was always meant\\nto be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\\nkept so by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations\\nknow of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned\\nit to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence\\nin the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my\\nbehaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars\\nmust seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.\\nAnd I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,\\nwhen he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has\\nthe highest opinion in the world of all your family,\\nand looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite\\nas his own sisters.\"--She paused.\\n\\nElinor for a few moments remained silent.\\nHer astonishment at what she heard was at first too\\ngreat for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,\\nand to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\\n\"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?\"\\n\\n\"We have been engaged these four years.\"\\n\\n\"Four years!\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nElinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable\\nto believe it.\\n\\n\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even\\nacquainted till the other day.\"\\n\\n\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.\\nHe was under my uncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"\\n\\n\"Your uncle!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk\\nof Mr. Pratt?\"\\n\\n\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion\\nof spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.\\n\\n\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple,\\nnear Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun,\\nfor my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,\\nand it was there our engagement was formed, though not till\\na year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost\\nalways with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and\\napprobation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved\\nhim too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--\\nThough you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,\\nyou must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\\nvery capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what\\nshe said; but after a moment\\'s reflection, she added,\\nwith revived security of Edward\\'s honour and love,\\nand her companion\\'s falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\\nFerrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at\\nwhat you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;\\nbut surely there must be some mistake of person or name.\\nWe cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward\\nFerrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,\\nand brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nis the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely\\nto be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\\ndepends.\"\\n\\n\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,\\n\"that I should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\\n\\n\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.\\nOur first care has been to keep the matter secret.--\\nYou knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,\\nthere could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name\\nto you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his\\nsister\\'s suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough\\nfor his not mentioning it.\"\\n\\nShe was silent.--Elinor\\'s security sunk; but her\\nself-command did not sink with it.\\n\\n\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she\\nwith a firm voice.\\n\\n\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have\\nto wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\"\\nThen taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,\\n\"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look\\nat this face.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,\\nbut yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person\\nit was drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"\\n\\nShe put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor\\nsaw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a\\ntoo hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood\\nmight suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of\\nits being Edward\\'s face.  She returned it almost instantly,\\nacknowledging the likeness.\\n\\n\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give\\nhim my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,\\nfor he has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am\\ndetermined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.\\nThey then proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world\\nof your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must\\nknow of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach\\nhis mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.\\nI shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\\nproud woman.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;\\n\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I\\nmay be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;\\nbut pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary\\na communication.  You must at least have felt that my\\nbeing acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\\n\\nAs she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,\\nhoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the\\nfalsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;\\nbut Lucy\\'s countenance suffered no change.\\n\\n\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great\\nliberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.\\nI have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,\\nbut I have known you and all your family by description\\na great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if\\nyou was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case,\\nI really thought some explanation was due to you after my\\nmaking such particular inquiries about Edward\\'s mother;\\nand I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose\\nadvice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that knows of it,\\nand she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great\\ndeal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\\nbetraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,\\nas you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest\\nfright in the world t\\'other day, when Edward\\'s name was\\nmentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.\\nYou can\\'t think how much I go through in my mind from\\nit altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what\\nI have suffered for Edward\\'s sake these last four years.\\nEvery thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing\\nhim so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.\\nI am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"\\n\\nHere she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did\\nnot feel very compassionate.\\n\\n\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,\\n\"I think whether it would not be better for us both\\nto break off the matter entirely.\"  As she said this,\\nshe looked directly at her companion.  \"But then\\nat other times I have not resolution enough for it.--\\nI cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,\\nas I know the very mention of such a thing would do.\\nAnd on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don\\'t\\nthink I could be equal to it.  What would you advise\\nme to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you\\ndo yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question;\\n\"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.\\nYour own judgment must direct you.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes\\nsilence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him\\nsometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!\\nDid you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at\\nBarton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,\\nto go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"\\n\\n\"Did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.\\nDid you think he came directly from town?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of\\nevery fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy\\'s veracity;\\n\"I remember he told us, that he had been staying\\na fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\\nShe remembered too, her own surprise at the time,\\nat his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,\\nat his total silence with respect even to their names.\\n\\n\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"\\nrepeated Lucy.\\n\\n\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you\\nshould suspect what was the matter; but it made him\\nso melancholy, not being able to stay more than a\\nfortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--\\nPoor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;\\nfor he writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just\\nbefore I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket\\nand carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.\\n\"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;\\nbut that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,\\nI dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\\nas possible.\"\\n\\nElinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt\\nno longer.  This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,\\nmight have been accidentally obtained; it might not have\\nbeen Edward\\'s gift; but a correspondence between them\\nby letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,\\ncould be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she\\nwas almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could\\nhardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;\\nand she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\\nof her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for\\nthe time complete.\\n\\n\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the\\nletter into her pocket, \"is the only comfort we have\\nin such long separations.  Yes, I have one other comfort\\nin his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.\\nIf he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.\\nI gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at\\nLongstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,\\nbut not equal to a picture.  Perhaps you might notice\\nthe ring when you saw him?\"\\n\\n\"I did,\" said Elinor, with a composure of voice,\\nunder which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond\\nany thing she had ever felt before.  She was mortified,\\nshocked, confounded.\\n\\nFortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage,\\nand the conversation could be continued no farther.\\nAfter sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles\\nreturned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty\\nto think and be wretched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\n\\nHowever small Elinor\\'s general dependence on\\nLucy\\'s veracity might be, it was impossible for her\\non serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,\\nwhere no temptation could be answerable to the folly\\nof inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy\\nhad asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not,\\ndared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every\\nside by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted\\nby nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of\\nacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation\\nfor the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward\\'s\\nvisit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,\\nhis dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain\\nbehaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the\\nMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections,\\nwhich had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,\\nthe ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,\\nas overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,\\nand established as a fact, which no partiality could\\nset aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment\\nof such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself;\\nbut other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.\\nHad Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he feigned\\na regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement\\nto Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might\\nonce have been, she could not believe it such at present.\\nHis affection was all her own.  She could not be deceived\\nin that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been\\nconscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not\\nan illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.\\nWhat a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  How much\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive!  He had been blamable,\\nhighly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first\\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought\\nto be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he\\nhad injured her, how much more had he injured himself;\\nif her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.\\nHis imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it\\nseemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever\\nbeing otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity;\\nbut HE, what had he to look forward to?  Could he\\never be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he,\\nwere his affection for herself out of the question,\\nwith his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,\\nbe satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,\\nand selfish?\\n\\nThe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally\\nblind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;\\nbut the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally\\nspent, give such improvement to the understanding, must\\nhave opened his eyes to her defects of education,\\nwhile the same period of time, spent on her side\\nin inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,\\nhad perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might\\nonce have given an interesting character to her beauty.\\n\\nIf in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself,\\nhis difficulties from his mother had seemed great,\\nhow much greater were they now likely to be, when\\nthe object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior\\nin connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.\\nThese difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated\\nfrom Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;\\nbut melancholy was the state of the person by whom the\\nexpectation of family opposition and unkindness, could\\nbe felt as a relief!\\n\\nAs these considerations occurred to her in painful\\nsuccession, she wept for him, more than for herself.\\nSupported by the conviction of having done nothing to\\nmerit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief\\nthat Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,\\nshe thought she could even now, under the first smart\\nof the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every\\nsuspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.\\nAnd so well was she able to answer her own expectations,\\nthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours\\nafter she had first suffered the extinction of all her\\ndearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the\\nappearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning\\nin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\nfrom the object of her love, and that Marianne was\\ninternally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose\\nwhole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she\\nexpected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.\\n\\nThe necessity of concealing from her mother and\\nMarianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,\\nthough it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no\\naggravation of Elinor\\'s distress.  On the contrary\\nit was a relief to her, to be spared the communication\\nof what would give such affliction to them, and to be\\nsaved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward,\\nwhich would probably flow from the excess of their partial\\naffection for herself, and which was more than she felt\\nequal to support.\\n\\nFrom their counsel, or their conversation, she knew\\nshe could receive no assistance, their tenderness and\\nsorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command\\nwould neither receive encouragement from their example\\nnor from their praise.  She was stronger alone,\\nand her own good sense so well supported her, that her\\nfirmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness\\nas invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,\\nit was possible for them to be.\\n\\nMuch as she had suffered from her first conversation\\nwith Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish\\nof renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.\\nShe wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\\nrepeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand\\nwhat Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any\\nsincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,\\nand she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her\\nreadiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness\\nin conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested\\nin it than as a friend, which she very much feared\\nher involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,\\nmust have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed\\nto be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain\\nthat Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,\\nnot merely from Lucy\\'s assertion, but from her venturing\\nto trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,\\nwith a secret so confessedly and evidently important.\\nAnd even Sir John\\'s joking intelligence must have had\\nsome weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remained so well\\nassured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,\\nit required no other consideration of probabilities\\nto make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;\\nand that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.\\nWhat other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\\nthere be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy\\'s\\nsuperior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him\\nin future?  She had little difficulty in understanding thus\\nmuch of her rival\\'s intentions, and while she was firmly\\nresolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\\nhonesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward\\nand to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy\\nthat her heart was unwounded.  And as she could now have\\nnothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\\nbeen told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going\\nthrough a repetition of particulars with composure.\\n\\nBut it was not immediately that an opportunity\\nof doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well\\ndisposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;\\nfor the weather was not often fine enough to allow\\nof their joining in a walk, where they might most easily\\nseparate themselves from the others; and though they\\nmet at least every other evening either at the park\\nor cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could\\nnot be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.\\nSuch a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s head; and therefore very little leisure\\nwas ever given for a general chat, and none at all for\\nparticular discourse.  They met for the sake of eating,\\ndrinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\\nor consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\\n\\nOne or two meetings of this kind had taken place,\\nwithout affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy\\nin private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,\\nto beg, in the name of charity, that they would all\\ndine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged\\nto attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be\\nquite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.\\nElinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\\nhad in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,\\nmore at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when\\nher husband united them together in one noisy purpose,\\nimmediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her\\nmother\\'s permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,\\nthough always unwilling to join any of their parties,\\nwas persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\\n\\nThe young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily\\npreserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.\\nThe insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor\\nhad expected; it produced not one novelty of thought\\nor expression, and nothing could be less interesting\\nthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\nparlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children\\naccompanied them, and while they remained there, she was\\ntoo well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy\\'s\\nattention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the\\nremoval of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed,\\nand Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation\\nat the park.  They all rose up in preparation for a round game.\\n\\n\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy,\\n\"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria\\'s\\nbasket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your\\neyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make\\nthe dear little love some amends for her disappointment\\nto-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.\"\\n\\nThis hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly\\nand replied, \"Indeed you are very much mistaken,\\nLady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can\\nmake your party without me, or I should have been at my\\nfiligree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,\\nI am resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\\n\\n\"You are very good, I hope it won\\'t hurt your eyes--\\nwill you ring the bell for some working candles?\\nMy poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know,\\nif the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I\\ntold her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends\\nupon having it done.\"\\n\\nLucy directly drew her work table near her\\nand reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\\nwhich seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\\ndelight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\\n\\nLady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.\\nNo one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual\\ninattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,\\n\"Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you\\nknow I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;\\nI have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  And without\\nfarther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\\n\\nLady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven\\nthat SHE had never made so rude a speech.\\n\\n\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument\\nyou know, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth\\naway the offence; \"and I do not much wonder at it; for it\\nis the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard.\"\\n\\nThe remaining five were now to draw their cards.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen\\nto cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,\\nin rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still\\nto be done to the basket, that it must be impossible\\nI think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.\\nI should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow\\nme a share in it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you\\nfor your help,\" cried Lucy, \"for I find there is more\\nto be done to it than I thought there was; and it would\\nbe a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele--\\n\"Dear little soul, how I do love her!\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor;\\n\"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be\\nas well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,\\nor will you take your chance now?\"\\n\\nElinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals,\\nand thus by a little of that address which Marianne\\ncould never condescend to practise, gained her own end,\\nand pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.  Lucy made room\\nfor her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were\\nthus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.\\nThe pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own\\nmusic and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten\\nthat any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily\\nso near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,\\nunder the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\n\\nIn a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\\n\\n\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have\\nhonoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,\\nor no farther curiosity on its subject.  I will\\nnot apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking\\nthe ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was\\nsomehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I\\ntold you that Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\"\\nand Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,\\n\"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give\\nyou such an idea.  Could you have a motive for the trust,\\nthat was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\\n\\n\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little\\nsharp eyes full of meaning, \"there seemed to me to be\\na coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\\nquite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was angry with me;\\nand have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\\ntook such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.\\nBut I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,\\nand that you really do not blame me.  If you knew what a\\nconsolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\\nof what I am always thinking of every moment of my life,\\nyour compassion would make you overlook every thing else\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great\\nrelief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be\\nassured that you shall never have reason to repent it.\\nYour case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to\\nbe surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need\\nof all your mutual affection to support you under them.\\nMr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\\n\\n\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would\\nbe madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,\\nI could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.\\nI have been always used to a very small income, and could\\nstruggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well\\nto be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that\\nhis mother might give him if he married to please her.\\nWe must wait, it may be for many years.  With almost every\\nother man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;\\nbut Edward\\'s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\\nI know.\"\\n\\n\"That conviction must be every thing to you;\\nand he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your\\'s.\\nIf the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed,\\nas between many people, and under many circumstances\\nit naturally would during a four years\\' engagement,\\nyour situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\\n\\nLucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful\\nin guarding her countenance from every expression\\nthat could give her words a suspicious tendency.\\n\\n\"Edward\\'s love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty\\nwell put to the test, by our long, very long absence\\nsince we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial\\nso well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.\\nI can safely say that he has never gave me one moment\\'s\\nalarm on that account from the first.\"\\n\\nElinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh\\nat this assertion.\\n\\nLucy went on.  \"I am rather of a jealous temper too\\nby nature, and from our different situations in life,\\nfrom his being so much more in the world than me, and our\\ncontinual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion,\\nto have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been\\nthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,\\nor any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,\\nor if he had talked more of one lady than another,\\nor seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he\\nused to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly\\nobservant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\\nI am sure I could not be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"All this,\" thought Elinor, \"is very pretty;\\nbut it can impose upon neither of us.\"\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she after a short silence,\\n\"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for\\nMrs. Ferrars\\'s death, which is a melancholy and shocking\\nextremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this,\\nand to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\\nin which it may involve you, rather than run the risk\\nof her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?\"\\n\\n\"If we could be certain that it would be only\\nfor a while!  But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong\\nproud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing\\nit, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,\\nand the idea of that, for Edward\\'s sake, frightens away\\nall my inclination for hasty measures.\"\\n\\n\"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying\\nyour disinterestedness beyond reason.\"\\n\\nLucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.\\n\\n\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor.\\n\\n\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he\\nis very unlike his brother--silly and a great coxcomb.\"\\n\\n\"A great coxcomb!\" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had\\ncaught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne\\'s music.--\\n\"Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No sister,\" cried Lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our\\nfavourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs.\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood\\'s is not,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; \"for he is one\\nof the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw;\\nbut as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature,\\nthere is no finding out who SHE likes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round\\nat them, \"I dare say Lucy\\'s beau is quite as modest\\nand pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood\\'s.\"\\n\\nElinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip,\\nand looked angrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took\\nplace for some time.  Lucy first put an end to it by saying\\nin a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them\\nthe powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--\\n\\n\"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has\\nlately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;\\nindeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you\\nare a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen enough\\nof Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\nother profession; now my plan is that he should take\\norders as soon as he can, and then through your interest,\\nwhich I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\\nfriendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me,\\nyour brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;\\nwhich I understand is a very good one, and the present\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while.  That would\\nbe enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time\\nand chance for the rest.\"\\n\\n\"I should always be happy,\" replied Elinor, \"to show\\nany mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars;\\nbut do you not perceive that my interest on such an\\noccasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is brother\\nto Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough\\nto her husband.\"\\n\\n\"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve\\nof Edward\\'s going into orders.\"\\n\\n\"Then I rather suspect that my interest would\\ndo very little.\"\\n\\nThey were again silent for many minutes.  At length\\nLucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,\\n\\n\"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end\\nto the business at once by dissolving the engagement.\\nWe seem so beset with difficulties on every side,\\nthat though it would make us miserable for a time,\\nwe should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will\\nnot give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed\\nvery agitated feelings, \"on such a subject I certainly\\nwill not.  You know very well that my opinion would have\\nno weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you wrong me,\" replied Lucy, with great\\nsolemnity; \"I know nobody of whose judgment I think\\nso highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe,\\nthat if you was to say to me, \\'I advise you by all means\\nto put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,\\nit will be more for the happiness of both of you,\\'\\nI should resolve upon doing it immediately.\"\\n\\nElinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward\\'s\\nfuture wife, and replied, \"This compliment would effectually\\nfrighten me from giving any opinion on the subject\\nhad I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;\\nthe power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\nis too much for an indifferent person.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said Lucy,\\nwith some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,\\n\"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.\\nIf you could be supposed to be biased in any respect\\nby your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having.\"\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this,\\nlest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase\\nof ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined\\nnever to mention the subject again.  Another pause\\ntherefore of many minutes\\' duration, succeeded this speech,\\nand Lucy was still the first to end it.\\n\\n\"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?\"\\nsaid she with all her accustomary complacency.\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other,\\nwhile her eyes brightened at the information,\\n\"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there!\\nBut I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure,\\nyour brother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"\\n\\n\"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation\\nif they do.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon\\nmeeting you there.  Anne and me are to go the latter end\\nof January to some relations who have been wanting us to\\nvisit them these several years!  But I only go for the sake\\nof seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise\\nLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.\"\\n\\nElinor was soon called to the card-table by the\\nconclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential\\ndiscourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,\\nto which both of them submitted without any reluctance,\\nfor nothing had been said on either side to make them\\ndislike each other less than they had done before;\\nand Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy\\npersuasion that Edward was not only without affection\\nfor the person who was to be his wife; but that he had\\nnot even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,\\nwhich sincere affection on HER side would have given,\\nfor self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man\\nto an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware\\nthat he was weary.\\n\\nFrom this time the subject was never revived by Elinor,\\nand when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity\\nof introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform\\nher confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter\\nfrom Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness\\nand caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;\\nfor she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which\\nLucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.\\n\\nThe visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was\\nlengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.\\nTheir favour increased; they could not be spared;\\nSir John would not hear of their going; and in spite\\nof their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter,\\nin spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill\\nthem immediately, which was in full force at the end\\nof every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two\\nmonths at the park, and to assist in the due celebration\\nof that festival which requires a more than ordinary\\nshare of private balls and large dinners to proclaim\\nits importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25\\n\\n\\nThough Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large\\nportion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,\\nshe was not without a settled habitation of her own.\\nSince the death of her husband, who had traded with success\\nin a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every\\nwinter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square.\\nTowards this home, she began on the approach of January\\nto turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,\\nand very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses\\nDashwood to accompany her.  Elinor, without observing\\nthe varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look\\nwhich spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave\\na grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations.\\nThe reason alleged was their determined resolution\\nof not leaving their mother at that time of the year.\\nMrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise,\\nand repeated her invitation immediately.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you\\nvery well, and I DO beg you will favour me with\\nyour company, for I\\'ve quite set my heart upon it.\\nDon\\'t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me,\\nfor I shan\\'t put myself at all out of my way for you.\\nIt will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I\\nhope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to go\\nvery well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\\nif you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good,\\nyou may always go with one of my daughters.  I am sure\\nyour mother will not object to it; for I have had such\\ngood luck in getting my own children off my hands that she\\nwill think me a very fit person to have the charge of you;\\nand if I don\\'t get one of you at least well married\\nbefore I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.\\nI shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,\\nyou may depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne\\nwould not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister\\nwould come into it.  It is very hard indeed that she\\nshould not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood\\ndoes not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off\\nfor town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying\\na word to Miss Dashwood about it.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be\\nmonstrous glad of Miss Marianne\\'s company, whether Miss\\nDashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I,\\nand I thought it would be more comfortable for them to\\nbe together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk\\nto one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.\\nBut one or the other, if not both of them, I must have.\\nLord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself,\\nI who have been always used till this winter to have\\nCharlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike\\nhands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change\\nher mind by and bye, why so much the better.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, ma\\'am, sincerely thank you,\" said Marianne,\\nwith warmth: \"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever,\\nand it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest\\nhappiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.\\nBut my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the\\njustice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be\\nmade less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no,\\nnothing should tempt me to leave her.  It should not,\\nmust not be a struggle.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood\\ncould spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now\\nunderstood her sister, and saw to what indifference to\\nalmost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\\nto be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her\\nmother\\'s decision, from whom however she scarcely expected\\nto receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,\\nwhich she could not approve of for Marianne, and which\\non her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.\\nWhatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager\\nto promote--she could not expect to influence the latter\\nto cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she\\nhad never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she\\ndared not explain the motive of her own disinclination\\nfor going to London.  That Marianne, fastidious as she was,\\nthoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings\\' manners,\\nand invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every\\ninconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever\\nmust be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her\\npursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,\\nso full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,\\nin spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.\\n\\nOn being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood,\\npersuaded that such an excursion would be productive\\nof much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving\\nthrough all her affectionate attention to herself,\\nhow much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear\\nof their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on\\ntheir both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,\\nwith her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that\\nwould accrue to them all, from this separation.\\n\\n\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried,\\n\"it is exactly what I could wish.  Margaret and I shall\\nbe as much benefited by it as yourselves.  When you\\nand the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly\\nand happily together with our books and our music! You\\nwill find Margaret so improved when you come back again!\\nI have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too,\\nwhich may now be performed without any inconvenience\\nto any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to town;\\nI would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of London.\\nYou will be under the care of a motherly good sort\\nof woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt.\\nAnd in all probability you will see your brother,\\nand whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,\\nwhen I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so\\nwholly estranged from each other.\"\\n\\n\"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\"\\nsaid Elinor, \"you have been obviating every impediment\\nto the present scheme which occurred to you, there is\\nstill one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so\\neasily removed.\"\\n\\nMarianne\\'s countenance sunk.\\n\\n\"And what,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, \"is my dear prudent\\nElinor going to suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she\\nnow to bring forward?  Do let me hear a word about the\\nexpense of it.\"\\n\\n\"My objection is this; though I think very well of\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s heart, she is not a woman whose society\\ncan afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give\\nus consequence.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of\\nher society, separately from that of other people,\\nyou will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will\\nalmost always appear in public with Lady Middleton.\"\\n\\n\"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of\\nMrs. Jennings,\" said Marianne, \"at least it need not prevent\\nMY accepting her invitation.  I have no such scruples,\\nand I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness\\nof that kind with very little effort.\"\\n\\nElinor could not help smiling at this display of\\nindifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she\\nhad often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave\\nwith tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,\\nthat if her sister persisted in going, she would\\ngo likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne\\nshould be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,\\nor that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\\nof Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.\\nTo this determination she was the more easily reconciled,\\nby recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy\\'s account,\\nwas not to be in town before February; and that\\ntheir visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,\\nmight be previously finished.\\n\\n\"I will have you BOTH go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\\n\"these objections are nonsensical.  You will have much\\npleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;\\nand if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,\\nshe would foresee it there from a variety of sources;\\nshe would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law\\'s family.\"\\n\\nElinor had often wished for an opportunity of\\nattempting to weaken her mother\\'s dependence on the\\nattachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might\\nbe less when the whole truth were revealed, and now\\non this attack, though almost hopeless of success,\\nshe forced herself to begin her design by saying,\\nas calmly as she could, \"I like Edward Ferrars very much,\\nand shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest\\nof the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference\\nto me, whether I am ever known to them or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.\\nMarianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor\\nconjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.\\n\\nAfter very little farther discourse, it was finally\\nsettled that the invitation should be fully accepted.\\nMrs. Jennings received the information with a great\\ndeal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;\\nnor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John\\nwas delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety\\nwas the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,\\nto the number of inhabitants in London, was something.\\nEven Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted,\\nwhich was putting herself rather out of her way;\\nand as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had\\nnever been so happy in their lives as this intelligence\\nmade them.\\n\\nElinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\\nher wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\\nto feel.  With regard to herself, it was now a matter\\nof unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when\\nshe saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,\\nand her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,\\nrestored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more\\nthan her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied\\nwith the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust\\nthe consequence.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,\\nso great was the perturbation of her spirits and her\\nimpatience to be gone.  Her unwillingness to quit her\\nmother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the\\nmoment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\\nHer mother\\'s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor\\nwas the only one of the three, who seemed to consider\\nthe separation as any thing short of eternal.\\n\\nTheir departure took place in the first week in January.\\nThe Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss\\nSteeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit\\nit only with the rest of the family.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 26\\n\\n\\nElinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings,\\nand beginning a journey to London under her protection,\\nand as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,\\nso short had their acquaintance with that lady been,\\nso wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,\\nand so many had been her objections against such a measure\\nonly a few days before! But these objections had all,\\nwith that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother\\nequally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,\\nin spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby\\'s constancy,\\ncould not witness the rapture of delightful expectation\\nwhich filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes\\nof Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,\\nhow cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,\\nand how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of\\nMarianne\\'s situation to have the same animating object\\nin view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a very\\nshort time however must now decide what Willoughby\\'s\\nintentions were; in all probability he was already in town.\\nMarianne\\'s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\\non finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon\\ngaining every new light as to his character which her\\nown observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\\nwith such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was\\nand what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\\nShould the result of her observations be unfavourable,\\nshe was determined at all events to open the eyes\\nof her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions\\nwould be of a different nature--she must then learn\\nto avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret\\nwhich might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\\n\\nThey were three days on their journey, and Marianne\\'s\\nbehaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what\\nfuture complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings\\nmight be expected to be.  She sat in silence almost all\\nthe way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever\\nvoluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\\nof delight exclusively addressed to her sister.  To atone\\nfor this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession\\nof the post of civility which she had assigned herself,\\nbehaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,\\ntalked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\\nwhenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side\\ntreated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous\\non every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only\\ndisturbed that she could not make them choose their own\\ndinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\\npreferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.\\nThey reached town by three o\\'clock the third day, glad to\\nbe released, after such a journey, from the confinement\\nof a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\\n\\nThe house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,\\nand the young ladies were immediately put in possession\\nof a very comfortable apartment.  It had formerly\\nbeen Charlotte\\'s, and over the mantelpiece still hung\\na landscape in coloured silks of her performance,\\nin proof of her having spent seven years at a great school\\nin town to some effect.\\n\\nAs dinner was not to be ready in less than two\\nhours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ\\nthe interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for\\nthat purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did the same.\\n\"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?\"\\n\\n\"I am NOT going to write to my mother,\"\\nreplied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid\\nany farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it immediately\\nstruck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was,\\nthat, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\\nthe affair, they must be engaged.  This conviction,\\nthough not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,\\nand she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\\nMarianne\\'s was finished in a very few minutes;\\nin length it could be no more than a note; it was then\\nfolded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.\\nElinor thought she could distinguish a large W in\\nthe direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,\\nringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it\\nto get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.\\nThis decided the matter at once.\\n\\nHer spirits still continued very high; but there\\nwas a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\\npleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as\\nthe evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,\\nand when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,\\nseemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\\n\\nIt was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings,\\nby being much engaged in her own room, could see little\\nof what was passing.  The tea things were brought in,\\nand already had Marianne been disappointed more than once\\nby a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,\\nElinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby\\'s approach,\\nand Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.\\nEvery thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;\\nshe opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,\\nand after listening half a minute, returned into the room\\nin all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\\nhim would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her\\nfeelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,\\n\"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed\\nalmost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel\\nBrandon appeared.\\n\\nIt was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,\\nand she immediately left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too;\\nbut at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured\\nhis welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that\\na man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\\nexperienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.\\nShe instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,\\nthat he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,\\nwith such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him\\nthe recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\\n\\n\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\\n\\nElinor answered in some distress that she was,\\nand then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;\\nand of every thing to which she could decently attribute\\nher sister\\'s behaviour.\\n\\nHe heard her with the most earnest attention,\\nbut seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,\\nand began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\\nin London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,\\nand the friends they had left behind.\\n\\nIn this calm kind of way, with very little interest\\non either side, they continued to talk, both of them out\\nof spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.\\nElinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were\\nthen in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain\\nby any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way\\nof saying something, she asked if he had been in London\\never since she had seen him last.  \"Yes,\" he replied,\\nwith some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have been\\nonce or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never\\nbeen in my power to return to Barton.\"\\n\\nThis, and the manner in which it was said,\\nimmediately brought back to her remembrance all the\\ncircumstances of his quitting that place, with the\\nuneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,\\nand she was fearful that her question had implied\\nmuch more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she,\\nwith her usual noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad\\nto see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your\\npardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little,\\nand settle my matters; for it is a long while since I\\nhave been at home, and you know one has always a world\\nof little odd things to do after one has been away for\\nany time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--\\nLord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!\\nBut pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should\\nbe in town today?\"\\n\\n\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer\\'s,\\nwhere I have been dining.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their\\nhouse?  How does Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine\\nsize by this time.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned\\nto tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel,\\nI have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,\\nyou see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.\\nYour friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be\\nsorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby\\nwill do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing\\nto be young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I\\nnever was very handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got\\na very good husband, and I don\\'t know what the greatest\\nbeauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has been dead\\nthese eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have\\nyou been to since we parted?  And how does your business\\ngo on?  Come, come, let\\'s have no secrets among friends.\"\\n\\nHe replied with his accustomary mildness to all\\nher inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.\\nElinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was\\nobliged to appear again.\\n\\nAfter her entrance, Colonel Brandon became\\nmore thoughtful and silent than he had been before,\\nand Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.\\nNo other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies\\nwere unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\\n\\nMarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits\\nand happy looks.  The disappointment of the evening before\\nseemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\\nthat day.  They had not long finished their breakfast before\\nMrs. Palmer\\'s barouche stopped at the door, and in a few\\nminutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted\\nto see them all, that it was hard to say whether she\\nreceived most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss\\nDashwoods again.  So surprised at their coming to town,\\nthough it was what she had rather expected all along;\\nso angry at their accepting her mother\\'s invitation\\nafter having declined her own, though at the same time\\nshe would never have forgiven them if they had not come!\\n\\n\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\"\\nsaid she; \"What do you think he said when he heard\\nof your coming with Mamma?  I forget what it was now,\\nbut it was something so droll!\"\\n\\nAfter an hour or two spent in what her mother called\\ncomfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry\\nconcerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings\\'s side,\\nand in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer\\'s, it was\\nproposed by the latter that they should all accompany\\nher to some shops where she had business that morning,\\nto which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,\\nas having likewise some purchases to make themselves;\\nand Marianne, though declining it at first was induced\\nto go likewise.\\n\\nWherever they went, she was evidently always on\\nthe watch.  In Bond Street especially, where much of\\ntheir business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;\\nand in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was\\nequally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others.\\nRestless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could\\nnever obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,\\nhowever it might equally concern them both: she received\\nno pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\\nhome again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation\\nat the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught\\nby every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild\\nto buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\\ntime in rapture and indecision.\\n\\nIt was late in the morning before they returned home;\\nand no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew\\neagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found\\nher turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,\\nwhich declared that no Willoughby had been there.\\n\\n\"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\"\\nsaid she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.\\nShe was answered in the negative.  \"Are you quite sure\\nof it?\" she replied.  \"Are you certain that no servant,\\nno porter has left any letter or note?\"\\n\\nThe man replied that none had.\\n\\n\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed\\nvoice, as she turned away to the window.\\n\\n\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself,\\nregarding her sister with uneasiness.  \"If she had not\\nknown him to be in town she would not have written to him,\\nas she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\\nand if he is in town, how odd that he should neither\\ncome nor write!  Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong\\nin permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,\\na man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,\\nso mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will MY\\ninterference be borne.\"\\n\\nShe determined, after some consideration, that if\\nappearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they\\nnow were, she would represent in the strongest manner\\nto her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the\\naffair.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nintimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited\\nin the morning, dined with them.  The former left them\\nsoon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;\\nand Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions,\\nas she would never learn the game; but though her time\\nwas therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no\\nmeans more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor,\\nfor it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the\\npain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured for a\\nfew minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,\\nand she returned to the more interesting employment\\nof walking backwards and forwards across the room,\\npausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,\\nin hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 27\\n\\n\\n\"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nwhen they met at breakfast the following morning,\\n\"Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;\\n\\'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day\\'s pleasure.\\nPoor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem\\nto take it so much to heart.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice,\\nand walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.\\n\"I had not thought of that.  This weather will keep many\\nsportsmen in the country.\"\\n\\nIt was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were\\nrestored by it.  \"It is charming weather for THEM indeed,\"\\nshe continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table\\nwith a happy countenance.  \"How much they must enjoy\\nit! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot\\nbe expected to last long.  At this time of the year,\\nand after such a series of rain, we shall certainly\\nhave very little more of it.  Frosts will soon set in,\\nand in all probability with severity.  In another day\\nor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last\\nlonger--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\\n\\n\"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent\\nMrs. Jennings from seeing her sister\\'s thoughts as clearly\\nas she did, \"I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady\\nMiddleton in town by the end of next week.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, my dear, I\\'ll warrant you we do.  Mary always\\nhas her own way.\"\\n\\n\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will\\nwrite to Combe by this day\\'s post.\"\\n\\nBut if she DID, the letter was written and sent away\\nwith a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain\\nthe fact.  Whatever the truth of it might be, and far\\nas Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,\\nyet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be\\nvery uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits;\\nhappy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier\\nin her expectation of a frost.\\n\\nThe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at\\nthe houses of Mrs. Jennings\\'s acquaintance to inform\\nthem of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time\\nbusy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the\\nvariations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning,\\nElinor? There seems to me a very decided difference.\\nI can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.  It was\\nnot so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem parting too,\\nthe sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\\nclear afternoon.\"\\n\\nElinor was alternately diverted and pained;\\nbut Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the\\nbrightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance\\nof the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be\\ndissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings\\'s style of living, and set\\nof acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,\\nwhich was invariably kind.  Every thing in her household\\narrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,\\nand excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s regret, she had never dropped, she visited\\nno one to whom an introduction could at all discompose\\nthe feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find\\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than\\nshe had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound\\nfor the want of much real enjoyment from any of their\\nevening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,\\nformed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, who had a general invitation\\nto the house, was with them almost every day; he came\\nto look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived\\nmore satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\\nother daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time\\nwith much concern his continued regard for her sister.\\nShe feared it was a strengthening regard.  It grieved her\\nto see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,\\nand his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.\\n\\nAbout a week after their arrival, it became\\ncertain that Willoughby was also arrived.  His card\\nwas on the table when they came in from the morning\\'s drive.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while\\nwe were out.\"  Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his\\nbeing in London, now ventured to say, \"Depend upon it,\\nhe will call again tomorrow.\"  But Marianne seemed\\nhardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning\\'s entrance,\\nescaped with the precious card.\\n\\nThis event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,\\nrestored to those of her sister all, and more than all,\\ntheir former agitation.  From this moment her mind was\\nnever quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour\\nof the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted\\non being left behind, the next morning, when the others\\nwent out.\\n\\nElinor\\'s thoughts were full of what might be passing\\nin Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment\\'s\\nglance at her sister when they returned was enough to\\ninform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.\\nA note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,\\n\\n\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"\\n\\nBut Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\\n\\n\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\\n\\n\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor,\\nunable to be longer silent.\\n\\n\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause.  \"You have no confidence\\nin me, Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have\\nconfidence in no one!\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,\\nMarianne, I have nothing to tell.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations\\nthen are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;\\nyou, because you do not communicate, and I, because\\nI conceal nothing.\"\\n\\nElinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,\\nwhich she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,\\nunder such circumstances, to press for greater openness\\nin Marianne.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being\\ngiven her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,\\nannouncing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,\\nand requesting the company of her mother and cousins\\nthe following evening.  Business on Sir John\\'s part,\\nand a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling\\nin Berkeley Street.  The invitation was accepted;\\nbut when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as\\nit was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they\\nshould both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still\\nshe had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was\\nnot more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling\\nto run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\\n\\nElinor found, when the evening was over,\\nthat disposition is not materially altered by a change\\nof abode, for although scarcely settled in town,\\nSir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\\nyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was\\nan affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.\\nIn the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;\\nbut in London, where the reputation of elegance was more\\nimportant and less easily attained, it was risking too much\\nfor the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that\\nLady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,\\nwith two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former,\\nwhom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,\\nas he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\\nto his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,\\nthey received no mark of recognition on their entrance.\\nHe looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\\nwho they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from\\nthe other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance\\nround the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE\\nwas not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed\\nto receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been\\nassembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards\\nthe Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\\nin town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed\\nof their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\\nsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come.\\n\\n\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\\n\\n\"When do you go back again?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\\n\\nNever had Marianne been so unwilling to dance\\nin her life, as she was that evening, and never so much\\nfatigued by the exercise.  She complained of it\\nas they returned to Berkeley Street.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason\\nof all that very well; if a certain person who shall\\nbe nameless, had been there, you would not have been a\\nbit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty\\nof him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\\n\\n\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\\n\\n\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir\\nJohn met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"\\nMarianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.\\nImpatient in this situation to be doing something\\nthat might lead to her sister\\'s relief, Elinor resolved\\nto write the next morning to her mother, and hoped\\nby awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,\\nto procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;\\nand she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne\\nwas again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose\\nit to be to any other person.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by\\nherself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,\\nwhile Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious\\nfor conversation, walked from one window to the other,\\nor sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\\nElinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,\\nrelating all that had passed, her suspicions of\\nWilloughby\\'s inconstancy, urging her by every plea\\nof duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\\nof her real situation with respect to him.\\n\\nHer letter was scarcely finished, when a rap\\nforetold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.\\nMarianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated\\ncompany of any kind, left the room before he entered it.\\nHe looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he\\nhad somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some\\ntime without saying a word.  Elinor, persuaded that he\\nhad some communication to make in which her sister\\nwas concerned, impatiently expected its opening.\\nIt was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\\nof conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with\\nthe observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"\\nor \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\\non the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\\nsomething particular about her.  After a pause of several\\nminutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her\\nin a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate\\nher on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not\\nprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,\\nwas obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,\\nof asking what he meant?  He tried to smile as he replied,\\n\"your sister\\'s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally\\nknown.\"\\n\\n\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor,\\n\"for her own family do not know it.\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon,\\nI am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not\\nsupposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,\\nand their marriage is universally talked of.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard\\nit mentioned?\"\\n\\n\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others\\nwith whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,\\nand the Middletons.  But still I might not have believed it,\\nfor where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\\nbe convinced, it will always find something to support\\nits doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to\\nMr. Willoughby in your sister\\'s writing.  I came to inquire,\\nbut I was convinced before I could ask the question.\\nIs every thing finally settled?  Is it impossible to-?\\nBut I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.\\nExcuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong\\nin saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on\\nyour prudence I have the strongest dependence.  Tell me\\nthat it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,\\nthat in short concealment, if concealment be possible,\\nis all that remains.\"\\n\\nThese words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal\\nof his love for her sister, affected her very much.\\nShe was not immediately able to say anything, and even\\nwhen her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short\\ntime, on the answer it would be most proper to give.\\nThe real state of things between Willoughby and her sister\\nwas so little known to herself, that in endeavouring\\nto explain it, she might be as liable to say too much\\nas too little.  Yet as she was convinced that Marianne\\'s\\naffection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s success, whatever the event of that affection\\nmight be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\\nfrom censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,\\nafter some consideration, to say more than she really knew\\nor believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though\\nshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms\\non which they stood with each other, of their mutual\\naffection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence\\nshe was not astonished to hear.\\n\\nHe listened to her with silent attention, and on\\nher ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,\\nand after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister\\nI wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\\n\\nElinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\\nconversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\\nother points; she was left, on the contrary, with a\\nmelancholy impression of Colonel Brandon\\'s unhappiness,\\nand was prevented even from wishing it removed,\\nby her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 28\\n\\n\\nNothing occurred during the next three or four days,\\nto make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying\\nto her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.\\nThey were engaged about the end of that time to attend\\nLady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was\\nkept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;\\nand for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,\\ncareless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent\\nwhether she went or staid, prepared, without one look\\nof hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the\\ndrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady\\nMiddleton\\'s arrival, without once stirring from her seat,\\nor altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,\\nand insensible of her sister\\'s presence; and when at\\nlast they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them\\nat the door, she started as if she had forgotten that\\nany one was expected.\\n\\nThey arrived in due time at the place of destination,\\nand as soon as the string of carriages before them\\nwould allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their\\nnames announced from one landing-place to another in an\\naudible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\\nquite full of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had\\npaid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady\\nof the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,\\nand take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to\\nwhich their arrival must necessarily add.  After some time\\nspent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat\\ndown to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for\\nmoving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,\\nplaced themselves at no great distance from the table.\\n\\nThey had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor\\nperceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards\\nof them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable\\nlooking young woman.  She soon caught his eye, and he\\nimmediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,\\nor to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;\\nand then continued his discourse with the same lady.\\nElinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether\\nit could be unobserved by her.  At that moment she first\\nperceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with\\nsudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,\\nhad not her sister caught hold of her.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he\\nis there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot\\nI speak to him?\"\\n\\n\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do\\nnot betray what you feel to every body present.\\nPerhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\\n\\nThis however was more than she could believe herself;\\nand to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond\\nthe reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.  She sat\\nin an agony of impatience which affected every feature.\\n\\nAt last he turned round again, and regarded them both;\\nshe started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone\\nof affection, held out her hand to him.  He approached,\\nand addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,\\nas if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\\nobserve her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after\\nMrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.\\nElinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,\\nand was unable to say a word.  But the feelings of her sister\\nwere instantly expressed.  Her face was crimsoned over,\\nand she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,\\n\"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?\\nHave you not received my letters?  Will you not shake\\nhands with me?\"\\n\\nHe could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed\\npainful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.\\nDuring all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.\\nElinor watched his countenance and saw its expression\\nbecoming more tranquil.  After a moment\\'s pause, he spoke\\nwith calmness.\\n\\n\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley\\nStreet last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was\\nnot fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings\\nat home.  My card was not lost, I hope.\"\\n\\n\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne\\nin the wildest anxiety.  \"Here is some mistake I am\\nsure--some dreadful mistake.  What can be the meaning\\nof it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven\\'s sake tell me,\\nwhat is the matter?\"\\n\\nHe made no reply; his complexion changed and all his\\nembarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye\\nof the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,\\nhe felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered\\nhimself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had the pleasure\\nof receiving the information of your arrival in town,\\nwhich you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away\\nwith a slight bow and joined his friend.\\n\\nMarianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable\\nto stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every\\nmoment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the\\nobservation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.\\n\\n\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she\\ncould speak, \"and force him to come to me.  Tell him\\nI must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--\\nI cannot rest--I shall not have a moment\\'s peace till this\\nis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--\\nOh go to him this moment.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,\\nyou must wait.  This is not the place for explanations.\\nWait only till tomorrow.\"\\n\\nWith difficulty however could she prevent her\\nfrom following him herself; and to persuade her to check\\nher agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance\\nof composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy\\nand more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued\\nincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery\\nof her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.\\nIn a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the\\ndoor towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he\\nwas gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again\\nthat evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.\\nShe instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady\\nMiddleton to take them home, as she was too miserable\\nto stay a minute longer.\\n\\nLady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,\\non being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too\\npolite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,\\nand making over her cards to a friend, they departed\\nas soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word\\nwas spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.\\nMarianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even\\nfor tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,\\nthey could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn\\nrestored her a little to herself.  She was soon undressed\\nand in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,\\nher sister then left her, and while she waited the return\\nof Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over\\nthe past.\\n\\nThat some kind of engagement had subsisted\\nbetween Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,\\nand that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;\\nfor however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,\\nSHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake\\nor misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough\\nchange of sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation\\nwould have been still stronger than it was, had she\\nnot witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak\\na consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been\\nsporting with the affections of her sister from the first,\\nwithout any design that would bear investigation.\\nAbsence might have weakened his regard, and convenience\\nmight have determined him to overcome it, but that such\\na regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself\\nto doubt.\\n\\nAs for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting\\nmust already have given her, and on those still more\\nsevere which might await her in its probable consequence,\\nshe could not reflect without the deepest concern.\\nHer own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\\ncould ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be\\ndivided in future, her mind might be always supported.\\nBut every circumstance that could embitter such an evil\\nseemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne\\nin a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate\\nand irreconcilable rupture with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 29\\n\\n\\nBefore the house-maid had lit their fire the next day,\\nor the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning\\nin January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling\\nagainst one of the window-seats for the sake of all\\nthe little light she could command from it, and writing\\nas fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.\\nIn this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation\\nand sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her\\nfor a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone\\nof the most considerate gentleness,\\n\\n\"Marianne, may I ask-?\"\\n\\n\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will\\nsoon know all.\"\\n\\nThe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said,\\nlasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately\\nfollowed by a return of the same excessive affliction.\\nIt was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,\\nand the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,\\nat intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her\\nfeeling how more than probable it was that she was writing\\nfor the last time to Willoughby.\\n\\nElinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention\\nin her power; and she would have tried to sooth and\\ntranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,\\nwith all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,\\nnot to speak to her for the world.  In such circumstances,\\nit was better for both that they should not be long together;\\nand the restless state of Marianne\\'s mind not only prevented\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,\\nbut requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,\\nmade her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding\\nthe sight of every body.\\n\\nAt breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat\\nany thing; and Elinor\\'s attention was then all employed,\\nnot in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing\\nto regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning\\'s\\nnotice entirely to herself.\\n\\nAs this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,\\nit lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting\\nthemselves, after it, round the common working table, when a\\nletter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught\\nfrom the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,\\ninstantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly\\nby this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must\\ncome from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness\\nat heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,\\nand sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it\\nimpossible to escape Mrs. Jenning\\'s notice.  That good lady,\\nhowever, saw only that Marianne had received a letter\\nfrom Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,\\nand which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,\\nthat she would find it to her liking.  Of Elinor\\'s distress,\\nshe was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted\\nfor her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing\\nher talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so\\ndesperately in love in my life!  MY girls were nothing\\nto her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as\\nfor Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.\\nI hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won\\'t keep her\\nwaiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her\\nlook so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when are they to be married?\"\\n\\nElinor, though never less disposed to speak than at\\nthat moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack\\nas this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, \"And have\\nyou really, Ma\\'am, talked yourself into a persuasion\\nof my sister\\'s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I thought\\nit had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems\\nto imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not\\ndeceive yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing\\nwould surprise me more than to hear of their being going\\nto be married.\"\\n\\n\"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you\\ntalk so?  Don\\'t we all know that it must be a match, that\\nthey were over head and ears in love with each other from\\nthe first moment they met?  Did not I see them together\\nin Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose\\nto buy wedding clothes?  Come, come, this won\\'t do.\\nBecause you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody\\nelse has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you,\\nfor it has been known all over town this ever so long.\\nI tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously,\\n\"you are mistaken.  Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing\\nin spreading the report, and you will find that you have\\nthough you will not believe me now.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not\\nspirits to say more, and eager at all events to know\\nwhat Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,\\nwhere, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on\\nthe bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\\nand two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near,\\nbut without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,\\ntook her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,\\nand then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first\\nwas scarcely less violent than Marianne\\'s. The latter,\\nthough unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness\\nof this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in\\njoint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor\\'s hands;\\nand then covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nalmost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,\\nshocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,\\nwatched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\nspent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby\\'s letter,\\nread as follows:\\n\\n                              \"Bond Street, January.\\n     \"MY DEAR MADAM,\\n\\n     \"I have just had the honour of receiving your\\n     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere\\n     acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there\\n     was anything in my behaviour last night that did\\n     not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at\\n     a loss to discover in what point I could be so\\n     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your\\n     forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been\\n     perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on\\n     my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire\\n     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter\\n     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\n     misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your\\n     whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so\\n     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than\\n     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself\\n     for not having been more guarded in my professions\\n     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more\\n     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand\\n     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,\\n     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before\\n     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great\\n     regret that I obey your commands in returning the\\n     letters with which I have been honoured from you,\\n     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed\\n     on me.\\n\\n     \"I am, dear Madam,\\n               \"Your most obedient\\n                    \"humble servant,\\n                                        \"JOHN WILLOUGHBY.\"\\n\\n\\nWith what indignation such a letter as this must\\nbe read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware,\\nbefore she began it, that it must bring a confession\\nof his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever,\\nshe was not aware that such language could be suffered\\nto announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every\\nhonourable and delicate feeling--so far from the common\\ndecorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently\\ncruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire\\nof a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no\\nbreach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--\\na letter of which every line was an insult, and which\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.\\n\\nShe paused over it for some time with indignant\\nastonishment; then read it again and again; but every\\nperusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man,\\nand so bitter were her feelings against him, that she\\ndared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\\nMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,\\nnot as a loss to her of any possible good but as an\\nescape from the worst and most irremediable of all\\nevils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man,\\nas a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.\\n\\nIn her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter,\\non the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,\\nand probably, on the very different mind of a very different\\nperson, who had no other connection whatever with the affair\\nthan what her heart gave him with every thing that passed,\\nElinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister,\\nforgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread,\\nand so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room,\\nthat when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door,\\nshe went to the window to see who could be coming so\\nunreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s chariot, which she knew had not been\\nordered till one.  Determined not to quit Marianne,\\nthough hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease,\\nshe hurried away to excuse herself from attending\\nMrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed.\\nMrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern\\nfor its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor,\\nafter seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she\\nfound attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached\\njust in time to prevent her from falling on the floor,\\nfaint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;\\nfor it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\\nnights since she had really slept; and now, when her\\nmind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense,\\nthe consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,\\na weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness.\\nA glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,\\nmade her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express\\nsome sense of her kindness, by saying,\\n\\n\"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!\"\\n\\n\"I only wish,\" replied her sister, \"there were\\nany thing I COULD do, which might be of comfort to you.\"\\n\\nThis, as every thing else would have been,\\nwas too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim,\\nin the anguish of her heart, \"Oh! Elinor, I am miserable,\\nindeed,\" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\\n\\nElinor could no longer witness this torrent\\nof unresisted grief in silence.\\n\\n\"Exert yourself, dear Marianne,\" she cried,\\n\"if you would not kill yourself and all who love you.\\nThink of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer:\\nfor her sake you must exert yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot, I cannot,\" cried Marianne; \"leave me,\\nleave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!\\nbut do not torture me so.  Oh! how easy for those,\\nwho have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion!  Happy,\\nhappy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And\\ncan you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!\"\\n\\n\"Forgive me, forgive me,\" throwing her arms round\\nher sister\\'s neck; \"I know you feel for me; I know what\\na heart you have; but yet you are--you must be happy;\\nEdward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such happiness\\nas that?\"\\n\\n\"Many, many circumstances,\" said Elinor, solemnly.\\n\\n\"No, no, no,\" cried Marianne wildly, \"he loves you,\\nand only you.  You CAN have no grief.\"\\n\\n\"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.\"\\n\\n\"And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is\\na misery which nothing can do away.\"\\n\\n\"You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no\\ncomforts? no friends?  Is your loss such as leaves\\nno opening for consolation?  Much as you suffer now,\\nthink of what you would have suffered if the discovery\\nof his character had been delayed to a later period--\\nif your engagement had been carried on for months and months,\\nas it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it.\\nEvery additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side,\\nwould have made the blow more dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"Engagement!\" cried Marianne, \"there has been\\nno engagement.\"\\n\\n\"No engagement!\"\\n\\n\"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.\\nHe has broken no faith with me.\"\\n\\n\"But he told you that he loved you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied,\\nbut never professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it\\nhad been--but it never was.\"\\n\\n\"Yet you wrote to him?\"--\\n\\n\"Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?--\\nBut I cannot talk.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more, and turning again to the three\\nletters which now raised a much stronger curiosity\\nthan before, directly ran over the contents of all.\\nThe first, which was what her sister had sent him\\non their arrival in town, was to this effect.\\n\\n                         Berkeley Street, January.\\n\\n     \"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on\\n     receiving this; and I think you will feel something\\n     more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.\\n     An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.\\n     Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.\\n     I wish you may receive this in time to come here\\n     to-night, but I will not depend on it.

I was repulsed indeed! I have\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse\\n     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than\\n     insulting; but though I have not yet been able to\\n     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,\\n     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of\\n     it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely\\n     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have\\n     lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,\\n     explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall\\n     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It\\n     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill\\n     of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that\\n     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that\\n     your regard for us all was insincere, that your\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let\\n     it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at\\n     present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish\\n     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be\\n     ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are\\n     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,\\n     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.\\n\\n                                             \"M.D.\"\\n\\nThat such letters, so full of affection and confidence,\\ncould have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby\\'s sake,\\nwould have been unwilling to believe.  But her condemnation\\nof him did not blind her to the impropriety of their\\nhaving been written at all; and she was silently grieving\\nover the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited\\nproofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,\\nand most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne,\\nperceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to\\nher that they contained nothing but what any one would\\nhave written in the same situation.\\n\\n\"I felt myself,\" she added, \"to be as solemnly\\nengaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant\\nhad bound us to each other.\"\\n\\n\"I can believe it,\" said Elinor; \"but unfortunately\\nhe did not feel the same.\"\\n\\n\"He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he\\nfelt it.  I know he did.  Whatever may have changed him now, (and\\nnothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done\\nit), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish.\\nThis lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up,\\nwas begged of me with the most earnest supplication.\\nHad you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice\\nat that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our\\nbeing together at Barton?  The morning that we parted\\ntoo!  When he told me that it might be many weeks before\\nwe met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?\"\\n\\nFor a moment or two she could say no more;\\nbut when this emotion had passed away, she added,\\nin a firmer tone,\\n\\n\"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he\\nhave been instigated?\"\\n\\n\"By all the world, rather than by his own heart.\\nI could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance\\nleagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe\\nhis nature capable of such cruelty.  This woman of whom he\\nwrites--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own\\ndear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous\\nto bely me.  Beyond you three, is there a creature\\nin the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil\\nthan Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?\"\\n\\nElinor would not contend, and only replied,\\n\"Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them\\nbe cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister,\\nby seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits.\\nIt is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists\\nsuch malevolence.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" cried Marianne, \"misery such as mine has\\nno pride.  I care not who knows that I am wretched.\\nThe triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world.\\nElinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and\\nindependent as they like--may resist insult, or return\\nmortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be\\nwretched--and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness\\nof it that can.\"\\n\\n\"But for my mother\\'s sake and mine--\"\\n\\n\"I would do more than for my own.  But to appear\\nhappy when I am so miserable--Oh! who can require it?\"\\n\\nAgain they were both silent.  Elinor was employed\\nin walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window,\\nfrom the window to the fire, without knowing that she\\nreceived warmth from one, or discerning objects through\\nthe other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,\\nwith her head leaning against one of its posts,\\nagain took up Willoughby\\'s letter, and, after shuddering\\nover every sentence, exclaimed--\\n\\n\"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this\\nbe yours!  Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor,\\nnothing can.  Whatever he might have heard against me--\\nought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to\\nhave told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing\\nmyself? \\'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\\nwhich you so obligingly bestowed on me\\'--That is unpardonable.\\nWilloughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?\\nOh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\"\\n\\n\"No, Marianne, in no possible way.\"\\n\\n\"And yet this woman--who knows what her art may\\nhave been?--how long it may have been premeditated,\\nand how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can\\nshe be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and\\nattractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one,\\nno one--he talked to me only of myself.\"\\n\\nAnother pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated,\\nand it ended thus.\\n\\n\"Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.\\nCan not we be gone to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow, Marianne!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for\\nWilloughby\\'s sake--and now who cares for me? Who regards me?\"\\n\\n\"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe\\nMrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of\\nthe commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot\\nstay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions\\nand remarks of all these people.  The Middletons and\\nPalmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity of such\\na woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!\"\\n\\nElinor advised her to lie down again, and for a\\nmoment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease;\\nand in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one\\nposture to another, till growing more and more hysterical,\\nher sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all,\\nand for some time was fearful of being constrained to call\\nfor assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she\\nwas at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from\\nthat time till Mrs. Jennings returned, she continued\\non the bed quiet and motionless.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 30\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return,\\nand without waiting to have her request of admittance answered,\\nopened the door and walked in with a look of real concern.\\n\\n\"How do you do my dear?\"--said she in a voice of great\\ncompassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without\\nattempting to answer.\\n\\n\"How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.--\\nNo wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married\\nvery soon--a good-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience\\nwith him.  Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago,\\nand she was told it by a particular friend of Miss\\nGrey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;\\nand I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I,\\nall I can say is, that if this be true, he has used\\na young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I\\nwish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.\\nAnd so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it.\\nI have no notion of men\\'s going on in this way; and if ever\\nI meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he\\nhas not had this many a day.  But there is one comfort,\\nmy dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man\\nin the world worth having; and with your pretty face\\nyou will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won\\'t\\ndisturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry\\nout at once and have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons\\nluckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her.\"\\n\\nShe then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room,\\nas if she supposed her young friend\\'s affliction could\\nbe increased by noise.\\n\\nMarianne, to the surprise of her sister,\\ndetermined on dining with them.  Elinor even advised\\nher against it.  But \"no, she would go down; she could\\nbear it very well, and the bustle about her would\\nbe less.\"  Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a\\nmoment by such a motive, though believing it hardly\\npossible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more;\\nand adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\\nwhile Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready\\nto assist her into the dining room as soon as they were\\nsummoned to it.\\n\\nWhen there, though looking most wretchedly,\\nshe ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected.\\nHad she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s well-meant but ill-judged attentions\\nto her, this calmness could not have been maintained;\\nbut not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction\\nof her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing\\nthat was passing before her.\\n\\nElinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings\\'s kindness,\\nthough its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes\\nalmost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments,\\nand returned her those civilities, which her sister could\\nnot make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw\\nthat Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing\\nwas due to her which might make her at all less so.\\nShe treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness\\nof a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\\nits holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,\\nwas to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house,\\nand to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.\\nHad not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,\\nseen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained\\nby Mrs. Jennings\\'s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,\\nby a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.\\nAs soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was\\nforced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could\\nstay no longer.  With a hasty exclamation of Misery,\\nand a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\\nup and hurried out of the room.\\n\\n\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone,\\n\"how it grieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is\\nnot gone away without finishing her wine!  And the dried\\ncherries too!  Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.\\nI am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would\\nsend all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest\\nthing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl\\nso ill!  But when there is plenty of money on one side,\\nand next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care\\nno more about such things!--\"\\n\\n\"The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--\\nis very rich?\"\\n\\n\"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see\\nher? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome.\\nI remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married\\na very wealthy man.  But the family are all rich together.\\nFifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won\\'t come\\nbefore it\\'s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.\\nNo wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!\\nWell, it don\\'t signify talking; but when a young man,\\nbe who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl,\\nand promises marriage, he has no business to fly off\\nfrom his word only because he grows poor, and a richer\\ngirl is ready to have him.  Why don\\'t he, in such a case,\\nsell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants,\\nand make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you,\\nMiss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters\\ncame round.  But that won\\'t do now-a-days; nothing in the\\nway of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of\\nthis age.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?\\nIs she said to be amiable?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever\\nheard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say\\nthis morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her,\\nthat she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry\\nto have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could\\nnever agree.\"--\\n\\n\"And who are the Ellisons?\"\\n\\n\"Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age\\nand may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has\\nmade!--What now,\" after pausing a moment--\"your poor sister\\nis gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself.\\nIs there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,\\nit seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we\\nshall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.\\nWhat shall we play at?  She hates whist I know; but is there\\nno round game she cares for?\"\\n\\n\"Dear ma\\'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.\\nMarianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again\\nthis evening.  I shall persuade her if I can to go\\nearly to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name\\nher own supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has\\nbeen looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two,\\nfor this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as\\nlong as that.  And so the letter that came today finished it!\\nPoor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,\\nI would not have joked her about it for all my money.\\nBut then you know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made\\nsure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and\\nyou know young people like to be laughed at about them.  Lord!\\nhow concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they\\nhear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have called\\nin Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.\\nBut I shall see them tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution\\nMrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby,\\nor making the slightest allusion to what has passed,\\nbefore my sister.  Their own good-nature must point out\\nto them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever\\nbe said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings\\nwill be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible\\nfor you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister,\\nI am sure I would not mention a word about it to her\\nfor the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.\\nNo more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are\\nall very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I\\ngive them a hint, as I certainly will.  For my part,\\nI think the less that is said about such things, the better,\\nthe sooner \\'tis blown over and forgot.  And what does\\ntalking ever do you know?\"\\n\\n\"In this affair it can only do harm; more so\\nperhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it\\nhas been attended by circumstances which, for the sake\\nof every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become\\nthe public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to\\nMr. Willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement\\nwith my sister.\"\\n\\n\"Law, my dear!  Don\\'t pretend to defend him.\\nNo positive engagement indeed! after taking her all\\nover Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they\\nwere to live in hereafter!\"\\n\\nElinor, for her sister\\'s sake, could not press the\\nsubject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her\\nfor Willoughby\\'s; since, though Marianne might lose much,\\nhe could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.\\nAfter a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,\\nwith all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, \\'tis a true saying about an ill-wind,\\nfor it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.\\nHe will have her at last; aye, that he will.  Mind me,\\nnow, if they an\\'t married by Mid-summer.  Lord! how he\\'ll\\nchuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.\\nIt will be all to one a better match for your sister.\\nTwo thousand a year without debt or drawback--except\\nthe little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;\\nbut she may be \\'prenticed out at a small cost, and then\\nwhat does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can\\ntell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place,\\nfull of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great\\ngarden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees\\nin the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!\\nLord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we\\nwere there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful\\nstew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,\\nin short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is\\nclose to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from\\nthe turnpike-road, so \\'tis never dull, for if you only\\ngo and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,\\nyou may see all the carriages that pass along.\\nOh! \\'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the village,\\nand the parsonage-house within a stone\\'s throw.\\nTo my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park,\\nwhere they are forced to send three miles for their meat,\\nand have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.\\nWell, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.\\nOne shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.\\nIf we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma\\'am,\" said Elinor,\\n\"we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon.\"\\nAnd then rising, she went away to join Marianne,\\nwhom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning,\\nin silent misery, over the small remains of a fire,\\nwhich, till Elinor\\'s entrance, had been her only light.\\n\\n\"You had better leave me,\" was all the notice\\nthat her sister received from her.\\n\\n\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go\\nto bed.\" But this, from the momentary perverseness\\nof impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.\\nHer sister\\'s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\\nsoon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her\\nlay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,\\nin a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,\\nshe was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass,\\nfull of something, in her hand.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected\\nthat I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the\\nhouse that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it\\nfor your sister.  My poor husband! how fond he was of it!\\nWhenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said\\nit did him more good than any thing else in the world.\\nDo take it to your sister.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference\\nof the complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good\\nyou are!  But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,\\nalmost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much\\nservice to her as rest, if you will give me leave,\\nI will drink the wine myself.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been\\nfive minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;\\nand Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,\\nthat though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,\\nof little importance to her, its healing powers,\\non a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\non herself as on her sister.\\n\\nColonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea,\\nand by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,\\nElinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\\nnor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\\nwas already aware of what occasioned her absence.\\nMrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;\\nfor soon after his entrance, she walked across the room\\nto the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--\\n\"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows\\nnothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\\n\\nHe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her\\'s,\\nand, with a look which perfectly assured her of his\\ngood information, inquired after her sister.\\n\\n\"Marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"She has been\\nindisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I\\nheard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it\\nthan I could believe possible at first.\"\\n\\n\"What did you hear?\"\\n\\n\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short,\\nthat a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I\\ntell you?  If you know it already, as surely you must,\\nI may be spared.\"\\n\\n\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness,\\n\"Mr. Willoughby\\'s marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO\\nknow it all.  This seems to have been a day of general\\nelucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.\\nMr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"In a stationer\\'s shop in Pall Mall, where I\\nhad business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,\\nand one of them was giving the other an account of the\\nintended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,\\nthat it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name\\nof Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,\\nfirst caught my attention; and what followed was a positive\\nassertion that every thing was now finally settled\\nrespecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer\\nto be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters.\\nOne thing, especially, I remember, because it served\\nto identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony\\nwas over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat\\nin Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be\\nimpossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative\\nlady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop\\ntill they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I\\nhave been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey\\'s guardian.\"\\n\\n\"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey\\nhas fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,\\nwe may find an explanation.\"\\n\\n\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least\\nI think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice\\nwhich seemed to distrust itself, \"And your sister--\\nhow did she--\"\\n\\n\"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have\\nonly to hope that they may be proportionately short.\\nIt has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday,\\nI believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,\\nperhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and,\\nin some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed!  But\\nyour sister does not--I think you said so--she does\\nnot consider quite as you do?\"\\n\\n\"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly\\nshe would still justify him if she could.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal\\nof the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,\\nthe subject was necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had\\nwatched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who\\nexpected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood\\'s communication,\\nin such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon\\'s side,\\nas might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope\\nand happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole\\nevening more serious and thoughtful than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 31\\n\\n\\nFrom a night of more sleep than she had expected,\\nMarianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\\nof misery in which she had closed her eyes.\\n\\nElinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\\nof what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had\\ngone through the subject again and again; and with the same\\nsteady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor\\'s side,\\nthe same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\\nMarianne\\'s, as before.  Sometimes she could believe\\nWilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,\\nand at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility\\nof acquitting him.  At one moment she was absolutely\\nindifferent to the observation of all the world, at another\\nshe would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\\ncould resist it with energy.  In one thing, however,\\nshe was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,\\nwhere it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,\\nand in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.\\nHer heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nentering into her sorrows with any compassion.\\n\\n\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;\\n\"she cannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;\\nher good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants\\nis gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\\n\\nElinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\\nto which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,\\nby the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too\\ngreat importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\\nstrong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.\\nLike half the rest of the world, if more than half there\\nbe that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent\\nabilities and an excellent disposition, was neither\\nreasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people\\nthe same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged\\nof their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\\non herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the\\nsisters were together in their own room after breakfast,\\nwhich sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower\\nin her estimation; because, through her own weakness,\\nit chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\\nthough Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse\\nof the utmost goodwill.\\n\\nWith a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance\\ngaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,\\nshe entered their room, saying,\\n\\n\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure\\nwill do you good.\"\\n\\nMarianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination\\nplaced before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness\\nand contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,\\nconvincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,\\nrushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,\\nby the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.\\nThe work of one moment was destroyed by the next.\\nThe hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,\\nwas before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment\\nwhich followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,\\nshe felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.\\n\\nThe cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within\\nher reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,\\ncould have expressed; and now she could reproach her\\nonly by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely\\nlost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,\\nshe withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.\\nBut the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,\\nbrought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.\\nHer mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying\\nas warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused\\nby Elinor\\'s application, to intreat from Marianne greater\\nopenness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness\\ntowards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such\\na conviction of their future happiness in each other,\\nthat she wept with agony through the whole of it.\\n\\nAll her impatience to be at home again now returned;\\nher mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through\\nthe very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,\\nand she was wildly urgent to be gone.  Elinor, unable herself\\nto determine whether it were better for Marianne to be\\nin London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\\nexcept of patience till their mother\\'s wishes could be known;\\nand at length she obtained her sister\\'s consent to wait\\nfor that knowledge.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she\\ncould not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able\\nto grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing\\nElinor\\'s offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\\nof the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of\\nthe pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,\\nby Marianne\\'s letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\\nany foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother\\nan account of what had passed, and entreat her directions\\nfor the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room\\non Mrs. Jennings\\'s going away, remained fixed at the table\\nwhere Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,\\ngrieving over her for the hardship of such a task,\\nand grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\\n\\nIn this manner they had continued about a quarter\\nof an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then\\nbear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.\\n\\n\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor.  \"So early too! I\\nthought we HAD been safe.\"\\n\\nMarianne moved to the window--\\n\\n\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation.\\n\"We are never safe from HIM.\"\\n\\n\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust to THAT,\" retreating to her own room.\\n\"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no\\nconscience in his intrusion on that of others.\"\\n\\nThe event proved her conjecture right, though it\\nwas founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon\\nDID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that\\nsolicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw\\nTHAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,\\ncould not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.\\n\\n\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he,\\nafter the first salutation, \"and she encouraged me\\nto come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,\\nbecause I thought it probable that I might find you alone,\\nwhich I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my\\nwish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe\\nit is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must\\nnot say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,\\nlasting conviction to your sister\\'s mind.  My regard for her,\\nfor yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,\\nby relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY\\nsincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being\\nuseful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours\\nhave been spent in convincing myself that I am right,\\nis there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?\"\\nHe stopped.\\n\\n\"I understand you,\" said Elinor.  \"You have something\\nto tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character\\nfarther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship\\nthat can be shewn Marianne.  MY gratitude will be insured\\nimmediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS\\nmust be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton\\nlast October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go\\nfarther back.  You will find me a very awkward narrator,\\nMiss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A short\\naccount of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it\\nSHALL be a short one.  On such a subject,\" sighing heavily,\\n\"can I have little temptation to be diffuse.\"\\n\\nHe stopt a moment for recollection, and then,\\nwith another sigh, went on.\\n\\n\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--\\n(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression\\non you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton\\nPark--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded\\nto a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,\\nyour sister Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have NOT forgotten it.\"\\nHe looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,\\n\\n\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality\\nof tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance\\nbetween them, as well in mind as person.  The same warmth\\nof heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.\\nThis lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from\\nher infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.\\nOur ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years\\nwe were playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the\\ntime when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,\\nas we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my\\npresent forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me\\nincapable of having ever felt.  Her\\'s, for me, was, I believe,\\nfervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\\nand it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.\\nAt seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was\\nmarried--married against her inclination to my brother.\\nHer fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\\nAnd this, I fear, is all that can be said for the\\nconduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\\nMy brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.\\nI had hoped that her regard for me would support her\\nunder any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at\\nlast the misery of her situation, for she experienced\\ngreat unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\\nshe had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I\\nrelate!  I have never told you how this was brought on.\\nWe were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.\\nThe treachery, or the folly, of my cousin\\'s maid betrayed us.\\nI was banished to the house of a relation far distant,\\nand she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\\ntill my father\\'s point was gained.  I had depended on her\\nfortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--\\nbut had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,\\na few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least\\nI should not have now to lament it.  This however\\nwas not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;\\nhis pleasures were not what they ought to have been,\\nand from the first he treated her unkindly.  The consequence\\nof this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced\\nas Mrs. Brandon\\'s, was but too natural.  She resigned\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation;\\nand happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we\\nwonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,\\nand without a friend to advise or restrain her (for\\nmy father lived only a few months after their marriage,\\nand I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\\nshould fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I\\nmeant to promote the happiness of both by removing\\nfrom her for years, and for that purpose had procured\\nmy exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\\nhe continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of\\ntrifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,\\nabout two years afterwards, of her divorce.  It was\\nTHAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection\\nof what I suffered--\"\\n\\nHe could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few\\nminutes about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,\\nand still more by his distress, could not speak.  He saw\\nher concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,\\nand kissed it with grateful respect.  A few minutes more\\nof silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\\n\\n\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy\\nperiod before I returned to England.  My first care,\\nwhen I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;\\nbut the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.\\nI could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there\\nwas every reason to fear that she had removed from him\\nonly to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance\\nwas not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her\\ncomfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that\\nthe power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he\\nimagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,\\nhad obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.\\nAt last, however, and after I had been six months in England,\\nI DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my own,\\nwho had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit\\nhim in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;\\nand there, the same house, under a similar confinement,\\nwas my unfortunate sister.  So altered--so faded--worn\\ndown by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I\\nbelieve the melancholy and sickly figure before me,\\nto be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\\non whom I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding\\nher--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\\nto describe it--I have pained you too much already.\\nThat she was, to all appearance, in the last stage\\nof a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\\nmy greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her,\\nbeyond giving time for a better preparation for death;\\nand that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,\\nand under proper attendants; I visited her every day\\nduring the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\\nlast moments.\"\\n\\nAgain he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor\\nspoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,\\nat the fate of his unfortunate friend.\\n\\n\"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,\" said he,\\n\"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my\\npoor disgraced relation.  Their fates, their fortunes,\\ncannot be the same; and had the natural sweet\\ndisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,\\nor a happier marriage, she might have been all that you\\nwill live to see the other be.  But to what does all this\\nlead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.\\nAh! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched\\nfor fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!\\nI WILL be more collected--more concise.  She left to my care\\nher only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first\\nguilty connection, who was then about three years old.\\nShe loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\\nIt was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly\\nwould I have discharged it in the strictest sense,\\nby watching over her education myself, had the nature\\nof our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home;\\nand my little Eliza was therefore placed at school.\\nI saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my\\nbrother, (which happened about five years ago, and which\\nleft to me the possession of the family property,) she\\nvisited me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;\\nbut I am well aware that I have in general been suspected\\nof a much nearer connection with her.  It is now three\\nyears ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)\\nthat I removed her from school, to place her under the care\\nof a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about\\nthe same time of life; and for two years I had every reason\\nto be pleased with her situation.  But last February,\\nalmost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.\\nI had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\\nout,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of\\nher young friends, who was attending her father there\\nfor his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,\\nand I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,\\nfor, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,\\nshe would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she\\ncertainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,\\nbut not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,\\ngive no information; for he had been generally confined\\nto the house, while the girls were ranging over the town\\nand making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried\\nto convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,\\nof his daughter\\'s being entirely unconcerned in the business.\\nIn short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;\\nall the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.\\nWhat I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I\\nsuffered too.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"could it be--could\\nWilloughby!\"--\\n\\n\"The first news that reached me of her,\" he continued,\\n\"came in a letter from herself, last October.\\nIt was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it\\non the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;\\nand this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\\nwhich I am sure must at the time have appeared strange\\nto every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.\\nLittle did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his\\nlooks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,\\nthat I was called away to the relief of one whom he\\nhad made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,\\nwhat would it have availed?  Would he have been less\\ngay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,\\nhe had already done that, which no man who CAN feel\\nfor another would do.  He had left the girl whose\\nyouth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of\\nthe utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,\\nno friends, ignorant of his address!  He had left her,\\npromising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,\\nnor relieved her.\"\\n\\n\"This is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed Elinor.\\n\\n\"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,\\nand worse than both.  Knowing all this, as I have now\\nknown it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing\\nyour sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured\\nthat she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\\nfor all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and\\nfound you alone, I came determined to know the truth;\\nthough irresolute what to do when it WAS known.\\nMy behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;\\nbut now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be\\nso deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?\\nI had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes\\nI thought your sister\\'s influence might yet reclaim him.\\nBut now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\\nwere his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been,\\nhowever, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL\\nturn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she\\ncompares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers\\nthe wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,\\nand pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,\\nstill as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented\\nby self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\\nSurely this comparison must have its use with her.\\nShe will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They\\nproceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.\\nOn the contrary, every friend must be made still more\\nher friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,\\nand respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\\nevery attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,\\nin communicating to her what I have told you.  You must\\nknow best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,\\nand from my heart believed it might be of service,\\nmight lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered\\nmyself to trouble you with this account of my family\\nafflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been\\nintended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s thanks followed this speech with grateful\\nearnestness; attended too with the assurance of her\\nexpecting material advantage to Marianne, from the\\ncommunication of what had passed.\\n\\n\"I have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her\\nendeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it\\nirritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction\\nof his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first she\\nwill suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.\\nHave you,\" she continued, after a short silence,\\n\"ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once I have.  One meeting\\nwas unavoidable.\"\\n\\nElinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously,\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"What? have you met him to--\"\\n\\n\"I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed\\nto me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;\\nand when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight\\nafter myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,\\nI to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded,\\nand the meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"\\n\\nElinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this;\\nbut to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.\\n\\n\"Such,\" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause,\\n\"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother\\nand daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!\"\\n\\n\"Is she still in town?\"\\n\\n\"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,\\nfor I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her\\nchild into the country, and there she remains.\"\\n\\nRecollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably\\ndividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,\\nreceiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,\\nand leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 32\\n\\n\\nWhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated\\nby Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,\\nthe effect on her was not entirely such as the former\\nhad hoped to see.  Not that Marianne appeared to distrust\\nthe truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all\\nwith the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\\nobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,\\nand seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to\\nbe impossible.  But though this behaviour assured Elinor\\nthat the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to\\nher mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,\\nin her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,\\nin her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,\\nwith a kind of compassionate respect, and though she\\nsaw her spirits less violently irritated than before,\\nshe did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did become\\nsettled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\\nShe felt the loss of Willoughby\\'s character yet more heavily\\nthan she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and\\ndesertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,\\nand the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been\\non herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\\neven to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,\\ngave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\\nby the most open and most frequent confession of them.\\n\\nTo give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood\\non receiving and answering Elinor\\'s letter would be only\\nto give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt\\nand said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than\\nMarianne\\'s, and an indignation even greater than Elinor\\'s.\\nLong letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;\\nto express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat\\nshe would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.\\nBad indeed must the nature of Marianne\\'s affliction be,\\nwhen her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying\\nand humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,\\nwhich SHE could wish her not to indulge!\\n\\nAgainst the interest of her own individual comfort,\\nMrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for\\nMarianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton,\\nwhere every thing within her view would be bringing back\\nthe past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,\\nby constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as\\nshe had always seen him there.  She recommended it to\\nher daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their\\nvisit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never\\nexactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least\\nfive or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects,\\nand of company, which could not be procured at Barton,\\nwould be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,\\ncheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,\\nand even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both\\nmight now be spurned by her.\\n\\nFrom all danger of seeing Willoughby again,\\nher mother considered her to be at least equally safe\\nin town as in the country, since his acquaintance must\\nnow be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.\\nDesign could never bring them in each other\\'s way:\\nnegligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise;\\nand chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London\\nthan even in the retirement of Barton, where it might\\nforce him before her while paying that visit at Allenham\\non his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\\nfirst as a probable event, had brought herself to expect\\nas a certain one.\\n\\nShe had yet another reason for wishing her children\\nto remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law\\nhad told her that he and his wife were to be in town\\nbefore the middle of February, and she judged it right\\nthat they should sometimes see their brother.\\n\\nMarianne had promised to be guided by her mother\\'s opinion,\\nand she submitted to it therefore without opposition,\\nthough it proved perfectly different from what she wished\\nand expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,\\nformed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her\\nlonger continuance in London it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal\\nsympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and\\nsuch scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment\\'s rest.\\n\\nBut it was a matter of great consolation to her,\\nthat what brought evil to herself would bring good to\\nher sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that\\nit would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely,\\ncomforted herself by thinking, that though their longer\\nstay would therefore militate against her own happiness,\\nit would be better for Marianne than an immediate return\\ninto Devonshire.\\n\\nHer carefulness in guarding her sister from ever\\nhearing Willoughby\\'s name mentioned, was not thrown away.\\nMarianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all\\nits advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John,\\nnor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\\nElinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended\\ntowards herself, but that was impossible, and she was\\nobliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.\\n\\nSir John, could not have thought it possible.\\n\"A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well!\\nSuch a good-natured fellow!  He did not believe there was a\\nbolder rider in England!  It was an unaccountable business.\\nHe wished him at the devil with all his heart.  He would\\nnot speak another word to him, meet him where he might,\\nfor all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side\\nof Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two\\nhours together.  Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such\\na deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they met\\nthat he had offered him one of Folly\\'s puppies! and this\\nwas the end of it!\"\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.\\n\"She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately,\\nand she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted\\nwith him at all.  She wished with all her heart Combe\\nMagna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated\\nhim so much that she was resolved never to mention\\nhis name again, and she should tell everybody she saw,\\nhow good-for-nothing he was.\"\\n\\nThe rest of Mrs. Palmer\\'s sympathy was shewn in procuring\\nall the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage,\\nand communicating them to Elinor.  She could soon tell\\nat what coachmaker\\'s the new carriage was building,\\nby what painter Mr. Willoughby\\'s portrait was drawn,\\nand at what warehouse Miss Grey\\'s clothes might be seen.\\n\\nThe calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton\\non the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor\\'s spirits,\\noppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness\\nof the others.  It was a great comfort to her to be sure\\nof exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their\\ncircle of friends: a great comfort to know that there\\nwas ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity\\nafter particulars, or any anxiety for her sister\\'s health.\\n\\nEvery qualification is raised at times, by the\\ncircumstances of the moment, to more than its real value;\\nand she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence\\nto rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort\\nthan good-nature.\\n\\nLady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair\\nabout once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred\\nvery often, by saying, \"It is very shocking, indeed!\"\\nand by the means of this continual though gentle vent,\\nwas able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the\\nfirst without the smallest emotion, but very soon\\nto see them without recollecting a word of the matter;\\nand having thus supported the dignity of her own sex,\\nand spoken her decided censure of what was wrong\\nin the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend\\nto the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore\\ndetermined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John)\\nthat as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance\\nand fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.\\n\\nColonel Brandon\\'s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries\\nwere never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly\\nearned the privilege of intimate discussion of her\\nsister\\'s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always\\nconversed with confidence.  His chief reward for the\\npainful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present\\nhumiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which\\nMarianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness\\nof her voice whenever (though it did not often happen)\\nshe was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.\\nTHESE assured him that his exertion had produced an\\nincrease of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave\\nElinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;\\nbut Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew\\nonly that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that\\nshe could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself,\\nnor commission her to make it for him, began, at the\\nend of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer,\\nthey would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the\\nend of a week that it would not be a match at all.\\nThe good understanding between the Colonel and Miss\\nDashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours\\nof the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,\\nwould all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had,\\nfor some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\nEarly in February, within a fortnight from the\\nreceipt of Willoughby\\'s letter, Elinor had the painful\\noffice of informing her sister that he was married.\\nShe had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed\\nto herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony\\nwas over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not\\nreceive the first notice of it from the public papers,\\nwhich she saw her eagerly examining every morning.\\n\\nShe received the news with resolute composure;\\nmade no observation on it, and at first shed no tears;\\nbut after a short time they would burst out, and for the\\nrest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable\\nthan when she first learnt to expect the event.\\n\\nThe Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married;\\nand Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger\\nof her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister,\\nwho had never yet left the house since the blow first fell,\\nto go out again by degrees as she had done before.\\n\\nAbout this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived\\nat their cousin\\'s house in Bartlett\\'s Buildings,\\nHolburn, presented themselves again before their more\\ngrand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets;\\nand were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\\n\\nElinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence\\nalways gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make\\na very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy\\nin finding her STILL in town.\\n\\n\"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not\\nfound you here STILL,\" said she repeatedly, with a strong\\nemphasis on the word.  \"But I always thought I SHOULD.\\nI was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile;\\nthough you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should\\nnot stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time,\\nthat you would most likely change your mind when it came\\nto the point.  It would have been such a great pity\\nto have went away before your brother and sister came.\\nAnd now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.\\nI am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.\"\\n\\nElinor perfectly understood her, and was forced\\nto use all her self-command to make it appear that she\\ndid NOT.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did\\nyou travel?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the stage, I assure you,\" replied Miss Steele,\\nwith quick exultation; \"we came post all the way, and had\\na very smart beau to attend us.  Dr. Davies was coming\\nto town, and so we thought we\\'d join him in a post-chaise;\\nand he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve\\nshillings more than we did.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"very pretty,\\nindeed! and the Doctor is a single man, I warrant you.\"\\n\\n\"There now,\" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering,\\n\"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I\\ncannot think why.  My cousins say they are sure I have\\nmade a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think\\nabout him from one hour\\'s end to another.  \\'Lord! here\\ncomes your beau, Nancy,\\' my cousin said t\\'other day,\\nwhen she saw him crossing the street to the house.\\nMy beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you mean.\\nThe Doctor is no beau of mine.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won\\'t do--\\nthe Doctor is the man, I see.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed!\" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness,\\n\"and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked\\nof.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying\\nassurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele\\nwas made completely happy.\\n\\n\"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother\\nand sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town,\"\\nsaid Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints,\\nto the charge.\\n\\n\"No, I do not think we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I dare say you will.\"\\n\\nElinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\\n\\n\"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can\\nspare you both for so long a time together!\"\\n\\n\"Long a time, indeed!\" interposed Mrs. Jennings.\\n\"Why, their visit is but just begun!\"\\n\\nLucy was silenced.\\n\\n\"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\"\\nsaid Miss Steele.  \"I am sorry she is not well--\"\\nfor Marianne had left the room on their arrival.\\n\\n\"You are very good.  My sister will be equally\\nsorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has\\nbeen very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches,\\nwhich make her unfit for company or conversation.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old\\nfriends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US;\\nand I am sure we would not speak a word.\"\\n\\nElinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.\\nHer sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her\\ndressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.\\n\\n\"Oh, if that\\'s all,\" cried Miss Steele, \"we can\\njust as well go and see HER.\"\\n\\nElinor began to find this impertinence too much for\\nher temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it,\\nby Lucy\\'s sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions,\\nthough it did not give much sweetness to the manners\\nof one sister, was of advantage in governing those of\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 33\\n\\n\\nAfter some opposition, Marianne yielded to her\\nsister\\'s entreaties, and consented to go out with her\\nand Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour. She\\nexpressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits,\\nand would do no more than accompany them to Gray\\'s in\\nSackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation\\nfor the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\\n\\nWhen they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected\\nthat there was a lady at the other end of the street\\non whom she ought to call; and as she had no business\\nat Gray\\'s, it was resolved, that while her young friends\\ntransacted their\\'s, she should pay her visit and\\nreturn for them.\\n\\nOn ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found\\nso many people before them in the room, that there was\\nnot a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they\\nwere obliged to wait.  All that could be done was, to sit\\ndown at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\\nquickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there,\\nand it is probable that Elinor was not without hope\\nof exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.\\nBut the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy\\nof his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.\\nHe was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself,\\nand till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined,\\nall of which, after examining and debating for a quarter\\nof an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,\\nwere finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had\\nno leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies,\\nthan what was comprised in three or four very broad stares;\\na kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor\\nthe remembrance of a person and face, of strong,\\nnatural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in\\nthe first style of fashion.\\n\\nMarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings\\nof contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination\\nof their features, and on the puppyism of his manner\\nin deciding on all the different horrors of the different\\ntoothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining\\nunconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\\nher thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was\\npassing around her, in Mr. Gray\\'s shop, as in her own bedroom.\\n\\nAt last the affair was decided.  The ivory,\\nthe gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment,\\nand the gentleman having named the last day on which his\\nexistence could be continued without the possession of the\\ntoothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care,\\nand bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such\\na one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration,\\nwalked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected\\nindifference.\\n\\nElinor lost no time in bringing her business forward,\\nwas on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman\\npresented himself at her side.  She turned her eyes towards\\nhis face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.\\n\\nTheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough\\nto make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray\\'s shop.\\nJohn Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see\\nhis sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction;\\nand his inquiries after their mother were respectful\\nand attentive.\\n\\nElinor found that he and Fanny had been in town\\ntwo days.\\n\\n\"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\"\\nsaid he, \"but it was impossible, for we were obliged\\nto take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange;\\nand we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.\\nHarry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended\\nto call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour,\\nbut one has always so much to do on first coming to town.\\nI am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal.  But tomorrow I\\nthink I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street,\\nand be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.\\nI understand she is a woman of very good fortune.\\nAnd the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM.\\nAs my mother-in-law\\'s relations, I shall be happy to show\\nthem every respect.  They are excellent neighbours to you in\\nthe country, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort,\\ntheir friendliness in every particular, is more than I\\ncan express.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word;\\nextremely glad indeed.  But so it ought to be; they are\\npeople of large fortune, they are related to you, and\\nevery civility and accommodation that can serve to make\\nyour situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.\\nAnd so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage\\nand want for nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming\\naccount of the place: the most complete thing of its kind,\\nhe said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond\\nany thing.  It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it,\\nI assure you.\"\\n\\nElinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother;\\nand was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him,\\nby the arrival of Mrs. Jennings\\'s servant, who came to tell\\nher that his mistress waited for them at the door.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced\\nto Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating\\nhis hope of being able to call on them the next day,\\ntook leave.\\n\\nHis visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at\\nan apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;\\n\"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really\\nshe had no leisure for going any where.\"  Mrs. Jennings,\\nhowever, assured him directly, that she should not stand\\nupon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something\\nlike it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John\\nDashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.\\nHis manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind;\\nto Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a\\ncuriosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know\\nhim to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.\\n\\nAfter staying with them half an hour, he asked\\nElinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce\\nhim to Sir John and Lady Middleton.  The weather was\\nremarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon\\nas they were out of the house, his enquiries began.\\n\\n\"Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man;\\nand I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect\\nof a very respectable establishment in life.\"\\n\\n\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am\\nconvinced of it.  What is the amount of his fortune?\"\\n\\n\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\\n\\n\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself\\nup to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,\\n\"Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much,\\nfor your sake.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am\\nvery sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish\\nof marrying ME.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.\\nA very little trouble on your side secures him.\\nPerhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness\\nof your fortune may make him hang back; his friends\\nmay all advise him against it.  But some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\\ngive will fix him, in spite of himself.  And there can be\\nno reason why you should not try for him.  It is not to be\\nsupposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,\\nyou know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\\nout of the question, the objections are insurmountable--\\nyou have too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon\\nmust be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on\\nmy part to make him pleased with you and your family.\\nIt is a match that must give universal satisfaction.\\nIn short, it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice\\nto an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome\\nto ALL PARTIES.\" Recollecting himself, however, he added,\\n\"That is, I mean to say--your friends are all truly\\nanxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly,\\nfor she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.\\nAnd her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,\\nI am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\\nthe other day.\"\\n\\nElinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\\n\\n\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued,\\n\"something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I\\na sister settling at the same time.  And yet it is not\\nvery unlikely.\"\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution,\\n\"going to be married?\"\\n\\n\"It is not actually settled, but there is such\\na thing in agitation.  He has a most excellent mother.\\nMrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,\\nand settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\\ntakes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\\nof the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.\\nA very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not\\na doubt of its taking place in time.  A thousand a-year\\nis a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over\\nfor ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give\\nyou another instance of her liberality:--The other day,\\nas soon as we came to town, aware that money could\\nnot be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes\\ninto Fanny\\'s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.\\nAnd extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\\nexpense while we are here.\"\\n\\nHe paused for her assent and compassion; and she\\nforced herself to say,\\n\\n\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly\\nbe considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\\n\\n\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.\\nI do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly\\na comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.\\nThe enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,\\nis a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little\\npurchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,\\nyou must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.\\nThe land was so very desirable for me in every respect,\\nso immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it\\nmy duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands.  A man must\\npay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal\\nof money.\"\\n\\n\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again,\\nthe next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the\\npurchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed;\\nfor the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not\\nhappened to have the necessary sum in my banker\\'s hands,\\nI must have sold out to very great loss.\"\\n\\nElinor could only smile.\\n\\n\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have\\nhad on first coming to Norland.  Our respected father,\\nas you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects\\nthat remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\\nto your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his\\ndoing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\\nown property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,\\nwe have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,\\nchina, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.\\nYou may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we\\nmust be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars\\'s\\nkindness is.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,\\nI hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\"\\nhe gravely replied; \"but however there is still a great\\ndeal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny\\'s\\ngreen-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden\\nmarked out.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\\n\\n\"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old\\nwalnut trees are all come down to make room for it.\\nIt will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,\\nand the flower-garden will slope down just before it,\\nand be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old\\nthorns that grew in patches over the brow.\"\\n\\nElinor kept her concern and her censure to herself;\\nand was very thankful that Marianne was not present,\\nto share the provocation.\\n\\nHaving now said enough to make his poverty clear,\\nand to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings\\nfor each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray\\'s\\nhis thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to\\ncongratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\n\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house,\\nher style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;\\nand it is an acquaintance that has not only been\\nof great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove\\nmaterially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is\\ncertainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it\\nspeaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all\\nprobability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--\\nShe must have a great deal to leave.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has\\nonly her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\\n\\n\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\\nher income.  Few people of common prudence will do THAT;\\nand whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.\"\\n\\n\"And do you not think it more likely that she\\nshould leave it to her daughters, than to us?\"\\n\\n\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married,\\nand therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her\\nremembering them farther.  Whereas, in my opinion, by her\\ntaking so much notice of you, and treating you in this\\nkind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her\\nfuture consideration, which a conscientious woman would\\nnot disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;\\nand she can hardly do all this, without being aware\\nof the expectation it raises.\"\\n\\n\"But she raises none in those most concerned.\\nIndeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity\\ncarries you too far.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself,\\n\"people have little, have very little in their power.\\nBut, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--\\nshe looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown\\nquite thin.  Is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint\\non her for several weeks.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life,\\nany thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!\\nHer\\'s has been a very short one!  She was as handsome a girl\\nlast September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract\\nthe man.  There was something in her style of beauty,\\nto please them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say\\nthat she would marry sooner and better than you did;\\nnot but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it\\nhappened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.\\nI question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth\\nmore than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,\\nand I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better.\\nDorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear\\nElinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;\\nand I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself\\namong the earliest and best pleased of your visitors.\"\\n\\nElinor tried very seriously to convince him that\\nthere was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon;\\nbut it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself\\nto be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking\\nan intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage\\nby every possible attention.  He had just compunction\\nenough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,\\nto be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should\\ndo a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon,\\nor a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect.\\n\\nThey were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton\\nat home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.\\nAbundance of civilities passed on all sides.  Sir John\\nwas ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did\\nnot seem to know much about horses, he soon set him\\ndown as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton\\nsaw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his\\nacquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away\\ndelighted with both.\\n\\n\"I shall have a charming account to carry\\nto Fanny,\" said he, as he walked back with his sister.\\n\"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!  Such\\na woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.\\nAnd Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,\\nthough not so elegant as her daughter.  Your sister need\\nnot have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say\\nthe truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally;\\nfor we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man\\nwho had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and\\nMrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither\\nshe nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny\\nwould like to associate with.  But now I can carry her\\na most satisfactory account of both.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 34\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her\\nhusband\\'s judgment, that she waited the very next day\\nboth on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her\\nconfidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying,\\nby no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton,\\nshe found her one of the most charming women in the world!\\n\\nLady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.\\nThere was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides,\\nwhich mutually attracted them; and they sympathised\\nwith each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,\\nand a general want of understanding.\\n\\nThe same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John\\nDashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit\\nthe fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing\\nmore than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,\\nwho met her husband\\'s sisters without any affection,\\nand almost without having anything to say to them;\\nfor of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street,\\nshe sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\\n\\nElinor wanted very much to know, though she did\\nnot chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town;\\nbut nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily\\nto mention his name before her, till able to tell her\\nthat his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on,\\nor till her husband\\'s expectations on Colonel Brandon\\nwere answered; because she believed them still so very\\nmuch attached to each other, that they could not be too\\nsedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\\nThe intelligence however, which SHE would not give,\\nsoon flowed from another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly\\nto claim Elinor\\'s compassion on being unable to see Edward,\\nthough he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.\\nHe dared not come to Bartlett\\'s Buildings for fear\\nof detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,\\nwas not to be told, they could do nothing at present\\nbut write.\\n\\nEdward assured them himself of his being in town,\\nwithin a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.\\nTwice was his card found on the table, when they returned\\nfrom their morning\\'s engagements.  Elinor was pleased\\nthat he had called; and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted\\nwith the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit\\nof giving anything, they determined to give them--\\na dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\\ninvited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had\\ntaken a very good house for three months.  Their sisters\\nand Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood\\nwas careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad\\nto be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\\ncivilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.\\nThey were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party.  The expectation\\nof seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested\\nin the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward\\'s\\nmother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\\nto attend such an introduction, though she could now see\\nher with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,\\nher desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars,\\nher curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\\n\\nThe interest with which she thus anticipated the\\nparty, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully\\nthan pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles\\nwere also to be at it.\\n\\nSo well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton,\\nso agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,\\nthat though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her\\nsister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John\\nto ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street;\\nand it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\\nSteeles, as soon as the Dashwoods\\' invitation was known,\\nthat their visit should begin a few days before the party\\ntook place.\\n\\nTheir claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nas the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had\\nhad the care of her brother, might not have done much,\\nhowever, towards procuring them seats at her table;\\nbut as Lady Middleton\\'s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family,\\nto have a nearer view of their characters and her own\\ndifficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\\nto please them, had seldom been happier in her life,\\nthan she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood\\'s card.\\n\\nOn Elinor its effect was very different.  She began\\nimmediately to determine, that Edward who lived with\\nhis mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party\\ngiven by his sister; and to see him for the first time,\\nafter all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\\nknew how she could bear it!\\n\\nThese apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded\\nentirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.\\nThey were relieved however, not by her own recollection,\\nbut by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be\\ninflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\\nthat Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,\\nand even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\\nby persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\\naffection for herself, which he could not conceal when they\\nwere together.\\n\\nThe important Tuesday came that was to introduce\\nthe two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.\\n\\n\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they\\nwalked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived\\nso directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed\\nthe servant at the same time--\"There is nobody here but\\nyou, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.\\nGood gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all\\nmy happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\\n\\nElinor could have given her immediate relief\\nby suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton\\'s mother,\\nrather than her own, whom they were about to behold;\\nbut instead of doing that, she assured her, and with\\ngreat sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\\namazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,\\nhoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,\\neven to formality, in her figure, and serious,\\neven to sourness, in her aspect.  Her complexion was sallow;\\nand her features small, without beauty, and naturally\\nwithout expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow\\nhad rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,\\nby giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.\\nShe was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people\\nin general, she proportioned them to the number of\\nher ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\\nnot one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed\\nwith the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\\n\\nElinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.--\\nA few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it\\nwas not in Mrs. Ferrars\\' power to distress her by it now;--\\nand the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles,\\na difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,\\nonly amused her.  She could not but smile to see the graciousness\\nof both mother and daughter towards the very person--\\nfor Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\\nhad they known as much as she did, they would have been most\\nanxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively\\nno power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.\\nBut while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,\\nshe could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from\\nwhich it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions\\nwith which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance,\\nwithout thoroughly despising them all four.\\n\\nLucy was all exultation on being so honorably\\ndistinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed\\nabout Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.\\n\\nThe dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous,\\nand every thing bespoke the Mistress\\'s inclination\\nfor show, and the Master\\'s ability to support it.\\nIn spite of the improvements and additions which were\\nmaking to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being\\nobliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom\\nof that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--\\nno poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--\\nbut there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood\\nhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\\nand his wife had still less.  But there was no peculiar\\ndisgrace in this; for it was very much the case with\\nthe chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured\\nunder one or other of these disqualifications for being\\nagreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\\nof elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\\n\\nWhen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room\\nafter dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,\\nfor the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some\\nvariety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\\nand breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one\\nsubject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,\\nwhich was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,\\nand Lady Middleton\\'s second son William, who were nearly\\nof the same age.\\n\\nHad both the children been there, the affair might\\nhave been determined too easily by measuring them at once;\\nbut as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural\\nassertion on both sides; and every body had a right to\\nbe equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it\\nover and over again as often as they liked.\\n\\nThe parties stood thus:\\n\\nThe two mothers, though each really convinced that\\nher own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour\\nof the other.\\n\\nThe two grandmothers, with not less partiality,\\nbut more sincerity, were equally earnest in support\\nof their own descendant.\\n\\nLucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent\\nthan the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall\\nfor their age, and could not conceive that there could\\nbe the smallest difference in the world between them;\\nand Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,\\nas fast as she could, in favour of each.\\n\\nElinor, having once delivered her opinion on\\nWilliam\\'s side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and\\nFanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing\\nit by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called\\non for her\\'s, offended them all, by declaring that she\\nhad no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\\n\\nBefore her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted\\na very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law,\\nwhich being now just mounted and brought home,\\nornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,\\ncatching the eye of John Dashwood on his following\\nthe other gentlemen into the room, were officiously\\nhanded by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.\\n\\n\"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you,\\nas a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.\\nI do not know whether you have ever happened to see any\\nof her performances before, but she is in general reckoned\\nto draw extremely well.\"\\n\\nThe Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions\\nto connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he\\nwould have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood;\\nand on the curiosity of the others being of course excited,\\nthey were handed round for general inspection.\\nMrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor\\'s work,\\nparticularly requested to look at them; and after they had\\nreceived gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons\\'s approbation,\\nFanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing\\nher, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.\\n\\n\"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without\\nregarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.\\n\\nPerhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother\\nhad been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little,\\nshe immediately said,\\n\\n\"They are very pretty, ma\\'am--an\\'t they?\" But then again,\\nthe dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself,\\nprobably came over her, for she presently added,\\n\\n\"Do you not think they are something in Miss\\nMorton\\'s style of painting, Ma\\'am?--She DOES paint most\\ndelightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\\n\\n\"Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.\"\\n\\nMarianne could not bear this.--She was already\\ngreatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed\\npraise of another, at Elinor\\'s expense, though she\\nhad not any notion of what was principally meant by it,\\nprovoked her immediately to say with warmth,\\n\\n\"This is admiration of a very particular kind!--\\nwhat is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, or who cares,\\nfor her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, she took the screens out of her\\nsister-in-law\\'s hands, to admire them herself as they\\nought to be admired.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing\\nherself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort\\nthis bitter philippic, \"Miss Morton is Lord Morton\\'s daughter.\"\\n\\nFanny looked very angry too, and her husband was\\nall in a fright at his sister\\'s audacity.  Elinor was\\nmuch more hurt by Marianne\\'s warmth than she had been\\nby what produced it; but Colonel Brandon\\'s eyes, as they\\nwere fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only\\nwhat was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could\\nnot bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s feelings did not stop here.  The cold\\ninsolence of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister,\\nseemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses\\nto Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think\\nof with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment,\\nto her sister\\'s chair, and putting one arm round her neck,\\nand one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager,\\nvoice,\\n\\n\"Dear, dear Elinor, don\\'t mind them.  Don\\'t let them\\nmake YOU unhappy.\"\\n\\nShe could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome,\\nand hiding her face on Elinor\\'s shoulder, she burst\\ninto tears.  Every body\\'s attention was called, and almost\\nevery body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went\\nto them without knowing what he did.--Mrs. Jennings,\\nwith a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\\nher her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged\\nagainst the author of this nervous distress, that he\\ninstantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele,\\nand gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole\\nshocking affair.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered\\nenough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among\\nthe rest; though her spirits retained the impression\\nof what had passed, the whole evening.\\n\\n\"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon,\\nin a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,--\\n\"She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very\\nnervous,--she has not Elinor\\'s constitution;--and one must\\nallow that there is something very trying to a young woman\\nwho HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions.\\nYou would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably\\nhandsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--\\nNow you see it is all gone.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 35\\n\\n\\nElinor\\'s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.--\\nShe had found in her every thing that could tend to make\\na farther connection between the families undesirable.--\\nShe had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her\\ndetermined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all\\nthe difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement,\\nand retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been\\notherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful\\nfor her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her\\nfrom suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s creation,\\npreserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any\\nsolicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she did not\\nbring herself quite to rejoice in Edward\\'s being fettered\\nto Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable,\\nshe OUGHT to have rejoiced.\\n\\nShe wondered that Lucy\\'s spirits could be so very much\\nelevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest\\nand her vanity should so very much blind her as to make\\nthe attention which seemed only paid her because she was\\nNOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow\\nher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\\nbecause her real situation was unknown.  But that it was so,\\nhad not only been declared by Lucy\\'s eyes at the time,\\nbut was declared over again the next morning more openly,\\nfor at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down\\nin Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,\\nto tell her how happy she was.\\n\\nThe chance proved a lucky one, for a message from\\nMrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\\n\\n\"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were\\nby themselves, \"I come to talk to you of my happiness.\\nCould anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars\\'s way\\nof treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable as she\\nwas!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--\\nbut the very moment I was introduced, there was such an\\naffability in her behaviour as really should seem to say,\\nshe had quite took a fancy to me.  Now was not it so?--\\nYou saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?\"\\n\\n\"She was certainly very civil to you.\"\\n\\n\"Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?--\\nI saw a vast deal more.  Such kindness as fell to the share\\nof nobody but me!--No pride, no hauteur, and your sister\\njust the same--all sweetness and affability!\"\\n\\nElinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still\\npressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness;\\nand Elinor was obliged to go on.--\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\"\\nsaid she, \"nothing could be more flattering than their\\ntreatment of you;--but as that was not the case\"--\\n\\n\"I guessed you would say so\"--replied Lucy\\nquickly--\"but there was no reason in the world why\\nMrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not,\\nand her liking me is every thing.  You shan\\'t talk me\\nout of my satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well,\\nand there will be no difficulties at all, to what I\\nused to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman,\\nand so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,\\nindeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable\\nMrs. Dashwood was!\"\\n\\nTo this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not\\nattempt any.\\n\\n\"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you\\ndon\\'t speak;--sure you an\\'t well.\"\\n\\n\"I never was in better health.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did\\nnot look it.  I should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have\\nbeen the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven\\nknows what I should have done without your friendship.\"--\\n\\nElinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting\\nher own success.  But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she\\ndirectly replied,\\n\\n\"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard\\nfor me, and next to Edward\\'s love, it is the greatest\\ncomfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one\\ngood thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often,\\nfor Lady Middleton\\'s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood,\\nso we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say,\\nand Edward spends half his time with his sister--besides,\\nLady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--\\nand Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\\nmore than once, they should always be glad to see me.--\\nThey are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you\\ntell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak\\ntoo high.\"\\n\\nBut Elinor would not give her any encouragement\\nto hope that she SHOULD tell her sister.  Lucy continued.\\n\\n\"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment,\\nif Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me.  If she had only\\nmade me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying\\na word, and never after had took any notice of me,\\nand never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know\\nwhat I mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding\\nsort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair.\\nI could not have stood it.  For where she DOES dislike,\\nI know it is most violent.\"\\n\\nElinor was prevented from making any reply to this\\ncivil triumph, by the door\\'s being thrown open, the servant\\'s\\nannouncing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward\\'s immediately walking in.\\n\\nIt was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each\\nshewed that it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish;\\nand Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk\\nout of the room again, as to advance farther into it.\\nThe very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form,\\nwhich they would each have been most anxious to avoid,\\nhad fallen on them.--They were not only all three together,\\nbut were together without the relief of any other person.\\nThe ladies recovered themselves first.  It was not Lucy\\'s\\nbusiness to put herself forward, and the appearance of\\nsecrecy must still be kept up.  She could therefore only\\nLOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,\\nsaid no more.\\n\\nBut Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she,\\nfor his sake and her own, to do it well, that she\\nforced herself, after a moment\\'s recollection,\\nto welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,\\nand almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\\nimproved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy,\\nnor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,\\nto deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,\\nand that she had very much regretted being from home,\\nwhen he called before in Berkeley Street.  She would\\nnot be frightened from paying him those attentions which,\\nas a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the\\nobservant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them\\nto be narrowly watching her.\\n\\nHer manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he\\nhad courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still\\nexceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case\\nrendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;\\nfor his heart had not the indifference of Lucy\\'s, nor\\ncould his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor\\'s.\\n\\nLucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined\\nto make no contribution to the comfort of the others,\\nand would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS\\nsaid, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer\\nall the information about her mother\\'s health, their coming\\nto town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\\nbut never did.\\n\\nHer exertions did not stop here; for she soon\\nafterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as\\nto determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne,\\nto leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\\nand THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away\\nseveral minutes on the landing-place, with the most\\nhigh-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.\\nWhen that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures\\nof Edward to cease; for Marianne\\'s joy hurried her into\\nthe drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him\\nwas like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,\\nand strongly spoken.  She met him with a hand that would\\nbe taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.\\n\\n\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great\\nhappiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?\"\\n\\nEdward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,\\nbut before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\\nreally felt.  Again they all sat down, and for a moment\\nor two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the\\nmost speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes\\nat Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each\\nother should be checked by Lucy\\'s unwelcome presence.\\nEdward was the first to speak, and it was to notice\\nMarianne\\'s altered looks, and express his fear of her\\nnot finding London agree with her.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t think of me!\" she replied with spirited\\nearnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears\\nas she spoke, \"don\\'t think of MY health.  Elinor is well,\\nyou see.  That must be enough for us both.\"\\n\\nThis remark was not calculated to make Edward or\\nElinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy,\\nwho looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.\\n\\n\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say\\nany thing that might introduce another subject.\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it,\\nbut I have found none.  The sight of you, Edward, is the\\nonly comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you\\nare what you always were!\"\\n\\nShe paused--no one spoke.\\n\\n\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must\\nemploy Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton.\\nIn a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust,\\nEdward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge.\"\\n\\nPoor Edward muttered something, but what it was,\\nnobody knew, not even himself.  But Marianne, who saw\\nhis agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever\\ncause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\\nand soon talked of something else.\\n\\n\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street\\nyesterday!  So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much\\nto say to you on that head, which cannot be said now.\"\\n\\nAnd with this admirable discretion did she defer\\nthe assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\\ndisagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly\\ndisgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.\\n\\n\"But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you\\nnot come?\"\\n\\n\"I was engaged elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends\\nwere to be met?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take\\nsome revenge on her, \"you think young men never stand\\nupon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them,\\nlittle as well as great.\"\\n\\nElinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely\\ninsensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,\\n\\n\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very\\nsure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.\\nAnd I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience\\nin the world; the most scrupulous in performing\\nevery engagement, however minute, and however it\\nmay make against his interest or pleasure.  He is the\\nmost fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,\\nand the most incapable of being selfish, of any body\\nI ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.\\nWhat! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you\\nmust be no friend of mine; for those who will accept\\nof my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.\"\\n\\nThe nature of her commendation, in the present case,\\nhowever, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the\\nfeelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very\\nunexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.\\n\\n\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward,\\nthis must not be.\"\\n\\nAnd drawing him a little aside, she whispered\\nher persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer.\\nBut even this encouragement failed, for he would go;\\nand Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours, soon afterwards went away.\\n\\n\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne,\\non her leaving them.  \"Could not she see that we wanted\\nher gone!--how teazing to Edward!\"\\n\\n\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been\\nthe longest known to him of any.  It is but natural\\nthat he should like to see her as well as ourselves.\"\\n\\nMarianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know,\\nElinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.\\nIf you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,\\nas I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect\\nthat I am the last person in the world to do it.\\nI cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are\\nnot really wanted.\"\\n\\nShe then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow\\nher to say more, for bound as she was by her promise\\nof secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that\\nwould convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences\\nof her still continuing in an error might be, she was\\nobliged to submit to it.  All that she could hope, was\\nthat Edward would not often expose her or himself to the\\ndistress of hearing Marianne\\'s mistaken warmth, nor to the\\nrepetition of any other part of the pain that had attended\\ntheir recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 36\\n\\n\\nWithin a few days after this meeting, the newspapers\\nannounced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer,\\nEsq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very\\ninteresting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all\\nthose intimate connections who knew it before.\\n\\nThis event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings\\'s happiness,\\nproduced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time,\\nand influenced, in a like degree, the engagements\\nof her young friends; for as she wished to be as much\\nas possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning\\nas soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late\\nin the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular\\nrequest of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day,\\nin every day in Conduit Street.  For their own comfort\\nthey would much rather have remained, at least all\\nthe morning, in Mrs. Jennings\\'s house; but it was not\\na thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.\\nTheir hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton\\nand the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact\\nwas as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\\n\\nThey had too much sense to be desirable companions\\nto the former; and by the latter they were considered with\\na jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing\\nthe kindness which they wanted to monopolize.  Though nothing\\ncould be more polite than Lady Middleton\\'s behaviour to\\nElinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\\nBecause they neither flattered herself nor her children,\\nshe could not believe them good-natured; and because they\\nwere fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps\\nwithout exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;\\nbut THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use,\\nand easily given.\\n\\nTheir presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.\\nIt checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.\\nLady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them,\\nand the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of\\nand administer at other times, she feared they would despise\\nher for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed\\nof the three, by their presence; and it was in their power\\nto reconcile her to it entirely.  Would either of them\\nonly have given her a full and minute account of the whole\\naffair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would\\nhave thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice\\nof the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\\narrival occasioned.  But this conciliation was not granted;\\nfor though she often threw out expressions of pity for her\\nsister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection\\non the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect\\nwas produced, but a look of indifference from the former,\\nor of disgust in the latter.  An effort even yet lighter\\nmight have made her their friend.  Would they only have\\nlaughed at her about the Doctor!  But so little were they,\\nanymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,\\nthat if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole\\nday without hearing any other raillery on the subject,\\nthan what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.\\n\\nAll these jealousies and discontents, however, were so\\ntotally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought\\nit a delightful thing for the girls to be together;\\nand generally congratulated her young friends every night,\\non having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.\\nShe joined them sometimes at Sir John\\'s, sometimes\\nat her own house; but wherever it was, she always came\\nin excellent spirits, full of delight and importance,\\nattributing Charlotte\\'s well doing to her own care, and ready\\nto give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,\\nas only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\\nOne thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her\\ndaily complaint.  Mr. Palmer maintained the common,\\nbut unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;\\nand though she could plainly perceive, at different times,\\nthe most striking resemblance between this baby and every\\none of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing\\nhis father of it; no persuading him to believe that it\\nwas not exactly like every other baby of the same age;\\nnor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\\nproposition of its being the finest child in the world.\\n\\nI come now to the relation of a misfortune,\\nwhich about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.\\nIt so happened that while her two sisters with\\nMrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,\\nanother of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance\\nin itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.\\nBut while the imaginations of other people will carry\\nthem away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,\\nand to decide on it by slight appearances, one\\'s happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.\\nIn the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed\\nher fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,\\nthat on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,\\nand understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood\\'s sisters,\\nshe immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;\\nand this misconstruction produced within a day\\nor two afterwards, cards of invitation for them\\nas well as for their brother and sister, to a small\\nmusical party at her house.  The consequence of which was,\\nthat Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only\\nto the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\\ncarriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,\\nmust be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\\nto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they\\nmight not expect to go out with her a second time?  The power\\nof disappointing them, it was true, must always be her\\'s.\\nBut that was not enough; for when people are determined\\non a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel\\ninjured by the expectation of any thing better from them.\\n\\nMarianne had now been brought by degrees, so much\\ninto the habit of going out every day, that it was become\\na matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:\\nand she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\\nevening\\'s engagement, though without expecting the smallest\\namusement from any, and very often without knowing,\\ntill the last moment, where it was to take her.\\n\\nTo her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\\nindifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,\\nduring the whole of her toilet, which it received from\\nMiss Steele in the first five minutes of their being\\ntogether, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute\\nobservation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,\\nand asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price\\nof every part of Marianne\\'s dress; could have guessed the\\nnumber of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\\nMarianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out\\nbefore they parted, how much her washing cost per week,\\nand how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\\nThe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,\\nwas generally concluded with a compliment, which\\nthough meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne\\nas the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing\\nan examination into the value and make of her gown,\\nthe colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,\\nshe was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word\\nshe looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would\\nmake a great many conquests.\"\\n\\nWith such encouragement as this, was she dismissed\\non the present occasion, to her brother\\'s carriage;\\nwhich they were ready to enter five minutes after it\\nstopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable\\nto their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\\nof her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay\\non their part that might inconvenience either herself\\nor her coachman.\\n\\nThe events of this evening were not very remarkable.\\nThe party, like other musical parties, comprehended a\\ngreat many people who had real taste for the performance,\\nand a great many more who had none at all; and the performers\\nthemselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\\nand that of their immediate friends, the first private\\nperformers in England.\\n\\nAs Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,\\nshe made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\\npianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even\\nby the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix\\nthem at pleasure on any other object in the room.  In one\\nof these excursive glances she perceived among a group\\nof young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture\\non toothpick-cases at Gray\\'s.  She perceived him soon\\nafterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly\\nto her brother; and had just determined to find out his\\nname from the latter, when they both came towards her,\\nand Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.\\n\\nHe addressed her with easy civility, and twisted\\nhis head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\\nwords could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb\\nshe had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had\\nit been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended\\nless on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest\\nrelations!  For then his brother\\'s bow must have given\\nthe finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother\\nand sister would have begun.  But while she wondered\\nat the difference of the two young men, she did not find\\nthat the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out\\nof all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.\\nWhy they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself\\nin the course of a quarter of an hour\\'s conversation;\\nfor, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\\nGAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing\\nin proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it\\nmuch less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune\\nof a private education; while he himself, though probably\\nwithout any particular, any material superiority\\nby nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\\n\\n\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more;\\nand so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving\\nabout it.  \\'My dear Madam,\\' I always say to her, \\'you must\\nmake yourself easy.  The evil is now irremediable,\\nand it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would\\nyou be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your\\nown judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,\\nat the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent\\nhim to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending\\nhim to Mr. Pratt\\'s, all this would have been prevented.\\'\\nThis is the way in which I always consider the matter,\\nand my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\\n\\nElinor would not oppose his opinion, because,\\nwhatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\\nof a public school, she could not think of Edward\\'s\\nabode in Mr. Pratt\\'s family, with any satisfaction.\\n\\n\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his\\nnext observation, \"in a cottage near Dawlish.\"\\n\\nElinor set him right as to its situation;\\nand it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\\ncould live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.\\nHe bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\\nspecies of house.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond\\nof a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much\\nelegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money\\nto spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,\\nwithin a short distance of London, where I might drive\\nmyself down at any time, and collect a few friends\\nabout me, and be happy.  I advise every body who is going\\nto build, to build a cottage.  My friend Lord Courtland\\ncame to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\\nand laid before me three different plans of Bonomi\\'s.\\nI was to decide on the best of them.  \\'My dear Courtland,\\'\\nsaid I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, \\'do not\\nadopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.\\'\\nAnd that I fancy, will be the end of it.\\n\\n\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,\\nno space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.\\nI was last month at my friend Elliott\\'s, near Dartford.\\nLady Elliott wished to give a dance.  \\'But how can it\\nbe done?\\' said she; \\'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it\\nis to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage\\nthat will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?\\'\\nI immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,\\nso I said, \\'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.\\nThe dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\\ncard-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library\\nmay be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the\\nsupper be set out in the saloon.\\'  Lady Elliott was delighted\\nwith the thought.  We measured the dining-room, and found\\nit would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair\\nwas arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact,\\nyou see, if people do but know how to set about it,\\nevery comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\\nas in the most spacious dwelling.\"\\n\\nElinor agreed to it all, for she did not think\\nhe deserved the compliment of rational opposition.\\n\\nAs John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\\neldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\\nany thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,\\nwhich he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,\\nwhen they got home.  The consideration of Mrs. Dennison\\'s\\nmistake,\\nin supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the\\npropriety of their being really invited to become such,\\nwhile Mrs. Jenning\\'s engagements kept her from home.\\nThe expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;\\nand it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\\nof his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\\ncomplete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.\\nFanny was startled at the proposal.\\n\\n\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she,\\n\"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day\\nwith her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.\\nYou know I am always ready to pay them any attention\\nin my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.\\nBut they are Lady Middleton\\'s visitors.  How can I ask them\\naway from her?\"\\n\\nHer husband, but with great humility, did not see\\nthe force of her objection.  \"They had already spent a week\\nin this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton\\ncould not be displeased at their giving the same number\\nof days to such near relations.\"\\n\\nFanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,\\n\\n\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it\\nwas in my power.  But I had just settled within myself\\nto ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.\\nThey are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think\\nthe attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\\nwell by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year,\\nyou know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.\\nI am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,\\nyou know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they\\nare such favourites with Harry!\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity\\nof inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience\\nwas pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters\\nanother year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting\\nthat another year would make the invitation needless,\\nby bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon\\'s wife,\\nand Marianne as THEIR visitor.\\n\\nFanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready\\nwit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,\\nto request her company and her sister\\'s, for some days,\\nin Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.\\nThis was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.\\nMrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;\\ncherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!\\nSuch an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,\\nabove all things, the most material to her interest,\\nand such an invitation the most gratifying to her\\nfeelings!  It was an advantage that could not be too\\ngratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;\\nand the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had\\nany precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been\\nalways meant to end in two days\\' time.\\n\\nWhen the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten\\nminutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,\\nsome share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark\\nof uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,\\nseemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose\\nfrom something more than merely malice against herself;\\nand might be brought, by time and address, to do\\nevery thing that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already\\nsubdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry\\ninto the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these\\nwere effects that laid open the probability of greater.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all\\nthat reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened\\nher expectation of the event.  Sir John, who called on\\nthem more than once, brought home such accounts of the\\nfavour they were in, as must be universally striking.\\nMrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any\\nyoung women in her life, as she was with them; had given\\neach of them a needle book made by some emigrant;\\ncalled Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know\\nwhether she should ever be able to part with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[At this point in the first and second edtions, Volume II ended.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 37\\n\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,\\nthat her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up\\nthe whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with\\nvisiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period\\nto her own home, and her own habits, in which she found\\nthe Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.\\n\\nAbout the third or fourth morning after their\\nbeing thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,\\non returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,\\nentered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting\\nby herself, with an air of such hurrying importance\\nas prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her\\ntime only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,\\nby saying,\\n\\n\"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am.  What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.--\\nWhen I got to Mr. Palmer\\'s, I found Charlotte quite\\nin a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very\\nill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\\nSo I looked at it directly, and, \\'Lord! my dear,\\'\\nsays I, \\'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--\\'\\nand nurse said just the same.  But Charlotte, she would\\nnot be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily\\nhe happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\\nstepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,\\nbe said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world\\nbut the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.  And so,\\njust as he was going away again, it came into my head,\\nI am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,\\nbut it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.\\nSo upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,\\nand seemed to know something or other, and at last he\\nsaid in a whisper, \\'For fear any unpleasant report\\nshould reach the young ladies under your care as to their\\nsister\\'s indisposition, I think it advisable to say,\\nthat I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope\\nMrs. Dashwood will do very well.\\'\"\\n\\n\"What! is Fanny ill?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  \\'Lord!\\' says I,\\n\\'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?\\' So then it all came out; and the\\nlong and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,\\nseems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young\\nman I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\\nturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing\\nin it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged\\nabove this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There\\'s for you,\\nmy dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,\\nexcept Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--\\nThere is no great wonder in their liking one another;\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them,\\nand nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened\\nto see them together, or I am sure I should have found it\\nout directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,\\nfor fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--\\ntill this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a\\nwell-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.\\n\\'Lord!\\' thinks she to herself, \\'they are all so fond\\nof Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;\\'\\nand so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all\\nalone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to\\ncome--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five\\nminutes before, that she thought to make a match between\\nEdward and some Lord\\'s daughter or other, I forget who.\\nSo you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\\nand pride.  She fell into violent hysterics immediately,\\nwith such screams as reached your brother\\'s ears,\\nas he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,\\nthinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.\\nSo up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,\\nfor Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\\nwhat was going on.  Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,\\nI think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded\\nlike any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.\\nNancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;\\nand your brother, he walked about the room, and said\\nhe did not know what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared\\nthey should not stay a minute longer in the house,\\nand your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,\\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\\nup their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,\\nand he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\\nand Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.\\nThe carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\\ncousins away, and they were just stepping in as he\\ncame off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\\nshe could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.\\nI declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\\nwith all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.\\nLord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he\\nhears of it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for\\nthey say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.\\nI should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\\npassion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I\\nhad a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,\\nthat he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may\\nbe within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she\\nwas sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,\\nfor your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;\\nand so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for\\neither of them.  I have no notion of people\\'s making\\nsuch a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no\\nreason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;\\nfor I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well\\nby her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,\\nshe knows better than any body how to make the most\\nof every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\\nallow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good\\nan appearance with it as any body else would with eight.\\nLord! how snug they might live in such another cottage\\nas yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;\\nand I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my\\nBetty has a sister out of place, that would fit them\\nexactly.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had\\ntime enough to collect her thoughts, she was able\\nto give such an answer, and make such observations,\\nas the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\\nHappy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\ninterest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late\\noften hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her\\nat all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,\\nin the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able\\nto speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to\\ngive her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality\\non the conduct of every one concerned in it.\\n\\nShe could hardly determine what her own expectation\\nof its event really was; though she earnestly tried\\nto drive away the notion of its being possible to end\\notherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.\\nWhat Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could\\nnot be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;\\nand still more anxious to know how Edward would\\nconduct himself.  For HIM she felt much compassion;--\\nfor Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure\\nthat little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\\n\\nAs Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,\\nElinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for\\nits discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,\\nin making her acquainted with the real truth, and in\\nendeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,\\nor any resentment against Edward.\\n\\nElinor\\'s office was a painful one.--She was going\\nto remove what she really believed to be her sister\\'s\\nchief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she\\nfeared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and\\nto make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\\nwhich to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\\ndisappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such a task\\nmust be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore\\nhastened to perform it.\\n\\nShe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\\nfeelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,\\nany otherwise than as the self-command she had practised\\nsince her first knowledge of Edward\\'s engagement, might\\nsuggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\\nHer narration was clear and simple; and though it could\\nnot be given without emotion, it was not accompanied\\nby violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged\\nrather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,\\nand cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter\\nof others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;\\nand all the comfort that could be given by assurances\\nof her own composure of mind, and a very earnest\\nvindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,\\nwas readily offered.\\n\\nBut Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.\\nEdward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging\\nas Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,\\ncould she feel less than herself!  As for Lucy Steele,\\nshe considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could\\nnot be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards\\nto pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.\\nShe would not even admit it to have been natural;\\nand Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,\\nby that which only could convince her, a better knowledge\\nof mankind.\\n\\nHer first communication had reached no farther than\\nto state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time\\nit had existed.--Marianne\\'s feelings had then broken in,\\nand put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some\\ntime all that could be done was to soothe her distress,\\nlessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first\\nquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars,\\nwas,\\n\\n\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has\\nhe written to you?\"\\n\\n\"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy\\nfirst came to Barton Park last November, she told me\\nin confidence of her engagement.\"\\n\\nAt these words, Marianne\\'s eyes expressed the astonishment\\nwhich her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,\\nshe exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\\n\\nElinor confirmed it.\\n\\n\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this\\nbeen on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being\\nhappy!\"--\\n\\n\"It was not fit that you should then know how much\\nI was the reverse!\"\\n\\n\"Four months!\"--cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!--\\nso cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--\\n\\n\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to\\nLucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,\\nto avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my\\nfamily and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,\\nwhich it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"\\n\\nMarianne seemed much struck.\\n\\n\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\\nmother,\" added Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it;--\\nbut without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--\\n\\n\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort\\nof others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing\\nhow much I felt.  Now, I can think and speak of it with\\nlittle emotion.  I would not have you suffer on my account;\\nfor I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.\\nI have many things to support me.  I am not conscious of having\\nprovoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,\\nI have borne it as much as possible without spreading\\nit farther.  I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.\\nI wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always\\ndoing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,\\nin the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,\\nand that is the foundation on which every thing good may\\nbe built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is\\nbewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,\\nand all that can be said of one\\'s happiness depending\\nentirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it\\nis not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--\\nEdward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior\\nin person and understanding to half her sex; and time\\nand habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\\nanother superior to HER.\"--\\n\\n\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne,\\n\"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily\\nto be made up by something else, your resolution,\\nyour self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\\nwondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever\\nfelt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this\\nhanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak\\nof it to a single creature; knowing that it would make\\nyou and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\nto you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--\\nIt was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the\\nvery person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all\\nmy prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--\\nThis person\\'s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,\\nby endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\\ndeeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have\\nhad her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--\\nI have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,\\nwithout hearing one circumstance that could make me less\\ndesire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;\\nnor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--\\nI have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,\\nand the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the\\npunishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--\\nAnd all this has been going on at a time, when, as you\\nknow too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--\\nIf you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you\\nmay suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure\\nof mind with which I have brought myself at present\\nto consider the matter, the consolation that I have been\\nwilling to admit, have been the effect of constant and\\npainful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--\\nthey did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--\\nNo, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,\\nperhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I\\nowed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was\\nVERY unhappy.\"--\\n\\nMarianne was quite subdued.--\\n\\n\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate\\nmyself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--\\nyou, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me\\nin all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering\\nfor me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I\\ncan make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself,\\nI have been trying to do it away.\"\\n\\nThe tenderest caresses followed this confession.\\nIn such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had\\nno difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\\nshe required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least\\nappearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying\\nthe smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see\\nEdward himself, if chance should bring them together,\\nwithout any diminution of her usual cordiality.--\\nThese were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt\\nthat she had injured, no reparation could be too much\\nfor her to make.\\n\\nShe performed her promise of being discreet,\\nto admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings\\nhad to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,\\ndissented from her in nothing, and was heard three\\ntimes to say, \"Yes, ma\\'am.\"--She listened to her praise\\nof Lucy with only moving from one chair to another,\\nand when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward\\'s affection,\\nit cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances\\ntowards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal\\nto any thing herself.\\n\\nThe next morning brought a farther trial of it,\\nin a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious\\naspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them\\nnews of his wife.\\n\\n\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity,\\nas soon as he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery\\nthat took place under our roof yesterday.\"\\n\\nThey all looked their assent; it seemed too awful\\na moment for speech.\\n\\n\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully.\\nMrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such\\ncomplicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may\\nbe weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.\\nPoor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.\\nBut I would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there\\nis nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution\\nis a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.\\nShe has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!\\nShe says she never shall think well of anybody again;\\nand one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--\\nmeeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness\\nhad been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!  It\\nwas quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she\\nhad asked these young women to her house; merely because\\nshe thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\\nwell-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;\\nfor otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\\nand Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,\\nwas attending her daughter.  And now to be so rewarded!\\n\\'I wish, with all my heart,\\' says poor Fanny in her\\naffectionate way, \\'that we had asked your sisters instead\\nof them.\\'\"\\n\\nHere he stopped to be thanked; which being done,\\nhe went on.\\n\\n\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny\\nbroke it to her, is not to be described.  While she with\\nthe truest affection had been planning a most eligible\\nconnection for him, was it to be supposed that he could\\nbe all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such\\na suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she\\nsuspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be\\nin THAT quarter.  \\'THERE, to be sure,\\' said she, \\'I might\\nhave thought myself safe.\\' She was quite in an agony.\\nWe consulted together, however, as to what should be done,\\nand at last she determined to send for Edward.\\nHe came.  But I am sorry to relate what ensued.\\nAll that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end\\nto the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\\nby my arguments, and Fanny\\'s entreaties, was of\\nno avail.  Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.\\nI never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.\\nHis mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case\\nof his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on\\nhim the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings\\nin a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\\ngrew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition\\nto this, if he still persisted in this low connection,\\nrepresented to him the certain penury that must attend\\nthe match.  His own two thousand pounds she protested\\nshould be his all; she would never see him again; and so far\\nwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance,\\nthat if he were to enter into any profession with a view\\nof better support, she would do all in her power to prevent\\nhim advancing in it.\"\\n\\nHere Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,\\nclapped her hands together, and cried, \"Gracious God!\\ncan this be possible!\"\\n\\n\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother,\\n\"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.\\nYour exclamation is very natural.\"\\n\\nMarianne was going to retort, but she remembered\\nher promises, and forbore.\\n\\n\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.\\nEdward said very little; but what he did say, was in\\nthe most determined manner.  Nothing should prevail on\\nhim to give up his engagement.  He would stand to it,\\ncost him what it might.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,\\nno longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest\\nman! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had\\ndone otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.\\nI have some little concern in the business, as well\\nas yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe\\nthere is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one\\nwho more deserves a good husband.\"\\n\\nJohn Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature\\nwas calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished\\nto offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.\\nHe therefore replied, without any resentment,\\n\\n\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\\nrelation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,\\na very deserving young woman, but in the present case\\nyou know, the connection must be impossible.\\nAnd to have entered into a secret engagement with a\\nyoung man under her uncle\\'s care, the son of a woman\\nespecially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,\\nis perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,\\nI do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\\nwhom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish\\nher extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct throughout\\nthe whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,\\nin like circumstances, would adopt.  It has been dignified\\nand liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear\\nit will be a bad one.\"\\n\\nMarianne sighed out her similar apprehension;\\nand Elinor\\'s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,\\nwhile braving his mother\\'s threats, for a woman who could\\nnot reward him.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--\\nEdward is dismissed for ever from his mother\\'s notice.\\nHe left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether\\nhe is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can\\nmake no inquiry.\"\\n\\n\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\\n\\n\"What, indeed, ma\\'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.\\nBorn to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive\\na situation more deplorable.  The interest of two thousand\\npounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added\\nthe recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,\\nwithin three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has\\nthirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself\\na more wretched condition.  We must all feel for him;\\nand the more so, because it is totally out of our power\\nto assist him.\"\\n\\n\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure\\nhe should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;\\nand so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit\\nthat he should be living about at his own charge now,\\nat lodgings and taverns.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward,\\nthough she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\\n\\n\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\"\\nsaid John Dashwood, \"as all his friends were disposed to do\\nby him, he might now have been in his proper situation,\\nand would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must\\nbe out of anybody\\'s power to assist him.  And there is one\\nthing more preparing against him, which must be worse than\\nall--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind\\nof spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,\\nwhich might have been Edward\\'s, on proper conditions.\\nI left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over\\nthe business.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is HER revenge.\\nEverybody has a way of their own.  But I don\\'t think mine\\nwould be, to make one son independent, because another had\\nplagued me.\"\\n\\nMarianne got up and walked about the room.\\n\\n\"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\"\\ncontinued John, \"than to see his younger brother in\\npossession of an estate which might have been his own?\\nPoor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.\"\\n\\nA few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,\\nconcluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his\\nsisters that he really believed there was no material\\ndanger in Fanny\\'s indisposition, and that they need\\nnot therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\\non the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded\\nMrs. Ferrars\\'s conduct, the Dashwoods\\', and Edward\\'s.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s indignation burst forth as soon as he\\nquitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve\\nimpossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings,\\nthey all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 38\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward\\'s\\nconduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its\\ntrue merit.  THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt\\nhim to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,\\nbeyond the consciousness of doing right, that could\\nremain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.\\nElinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all\\nhis offences in compassion for his punishment.  But though\\nconfidence between them was, by this public discovery,\\nrestored to its proper state, it was not a subject on\\nwhich either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.\\nElinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still\\nmore upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive\\nassurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward\\'s continued\\naffection for herself which she rather wished to do away;\\nand Marianne\\'s courage soon failed her, in trying\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more\\ndissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison\\nit necessarily produced between Elinor\\'s conduct and her own.\\n\\nShe felt all the force of that comparison; but not\\nas her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;\\nshe felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,\\nregretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\\nherself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\\nwithout the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened\\nthat she still fancied present exertion impossible,\\nand therefore it only dispirited her more.\\n\\nNothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,\\nof affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett\\'s Buildings.\\nBut though so much of the matter was known to them already,\\nthat Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\\nthat knowledge farther, without seeking after more,\\nshe had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;\\nand nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,\\nhad prevented her going to them within that time.\\n\\nThe third day succeeding their knowledge of the\\nparticulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw\\nmany to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second\\nweek in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;\\nbut Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again\\nin town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,\\nchose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public\\na place.\\n\\nAn intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined\\nthem soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was\\nnot sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging\\nall Mrs. Jennings\\'s conversation, she was herself left\\nto quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\\nnothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody\\nwho could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting\\nto her.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,\\naccosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,\\nexpressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving\\nencouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\\nleft her own party for a short time, to join their\\'s.\\nMrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,\\n\\n\"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you\\nany thing if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\\n\\nIt was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings\\'s curiosity\\nand Elinor\\'s too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT\\nbeing asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.\\n\\n\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele,\\ntaking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you\\nof all things in the world.\"  And then lowering her voice,\\n\"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.\\nIs she angry?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\\n\\n\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\\n\\n\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have\\nhad such a time of it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage\\nin my life.  She vowed at first she would never trim me\\nup a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,\\nso long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,\\nand we are as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me\\nthis bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.\\nThere now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.  But why\\nshould not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS\\nthe Doctor\\'s favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,\\nI should never have known he DID like it better than\\nany other colour, if he had not happened to say so.\\nMy cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare sometimes\\nI do not know which way to look before them.\"\\n\\nShe had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor\\nhad nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient\\nto find her way back again to the first.\\n\\n\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly,\\n\"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars\\'s\\ndeclaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing\\nI can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured\\nreports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think\\nabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other\\npeople to set it down for certain.\"\\n\\n\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,\\nI assure you,\" said Elinor.\\n\\n\"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well,\\nand by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,\\nthat nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars\\nto give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand\\npounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\\nnothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.\\nAnd besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,\\nthat when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars\\nwould be off; and when Edward did not come near us\\nfor three days, I could not tell what to think myself;\\nand I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;\\nfor we came away from your brother\\'s Wednesday,\\nand we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,\\nand Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.\\nOnce Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits\\nrose against that.  However this morning he came just\\nas we came home from church; and then it all came out,\\nhow he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them,\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved\\nnobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.\\nAnd how he had been so worried by what passed,\\nthat as soon as he had went away from his mother\\'s house,\\nhe had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,\\nsome where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn\\nall Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better\\nof it.  And after thinking it all over and over again,\\nhe said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\\nand no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep\\nher on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,\\nfor he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope\\nof any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,\\nas he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,\\nand how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear\\nto think of her doing no better, and so he begged,\\nif she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the\\nmatter directly, and leave him shift for himself.\\nI heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\\nAnd it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,\\nthat he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.\\nI will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\\ntired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any\\nthing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give\\near to such kind of talking; so she told him directly\\n(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,\\nand all that--Oh, la! one can\\'t repeat such kind of things\\nyou know)--she told him directly, she had not the least\\nmind in the world to be off, for she could live with him\\nupon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,\\nshe should be very glad to have it all, you know,\\nor something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,\\nand talked on some time about what they should do,\\nand they agreed he should take orders directly,\\nand they must wait to be married till he got a living.\\nAnd just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\\ncalled from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in\\nher coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;\\nso I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,\\nto ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not\\ncare to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put\\non a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"\\nsaid Elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,\\nwere not you?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you\\nthink people make love when any body else is by?  Oh,\\nfor shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.\\n(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the\\ndrawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening\\nat the door.\"\\n\\n\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me\\nwhat you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?\\nI am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly\\nwould not have suffered you to give me particulars of a\\nconversation which you ought not to have known yourself.\\nHow could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at\\nthe door, and heard what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would\\nhave done just the same by me; for a year or two back,\\nwhen Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,\\nshe never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind\\na chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\\n\\nElinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss\\nSteele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,\\nfrom what was uppermost in her mind.\\n\\n\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she;\\n\"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an\\nill-natured woman his mother is, an\\'t she? And your\\nbrother and sister were not very kind! However,\\nI shan\\'t say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure\\nthey did send us home in their own chariot, which\\nwas more than I looked for.  And for my part, I was all\\nin a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the\\nhuswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\\nnothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine\\nout of sight.  Edward have got some business at Oxford,\\nhe says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,\\nas soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.\\nI wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!\\n(giggling as she spoke) I\\'d lay my life I know what\\nmy cousins will say, when they hear of it.  They will\\ntell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward\\nthe curacy of his new living.  I know they will; but I am\\nsure I would not do such a thing for all the world.--\\n\\'La!\\' I shall say directly, \\'I wonder how you could think\\nof such a thing?  I write to the Doctor, indeed!\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared\\nagainst the worst.  You have got your answer ready.\"\\n\\nMiss Steele was going to reply on the same subject,\\nbut the approach of her own party made another more necessary.\\n\\n\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal\\nmore to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not\\nany longer.  I assure you they are very genteel people.\\nHe makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their\\nown coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about\\nit myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she\\nis not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same;\\nand if anything should happen to take you and your\\nsister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company,\\nI am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her\\nfor as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton\\nwon\\'t ask us any more this bout.  Good-by; I am sorry\\nMiss Marianne was not here.  Remember me kindly to her.\\nLa! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder\\nyou was not afraid of its being torn.\"\\n\\nSuch was her parting concern; for after this, she had\\ntime only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,\\nbefore her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson;\\nand Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which\\nmight feed her powers of reflection some time, though she\\nhad learnt very little more than what had been already\\nforeseen and foreplanned in her own mind.  Edward\\'s marriage\\nwith Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time\\nof its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,\\nas she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,\\nexactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,\\nof which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.\\n\\nAs soon as they returned to the carriage,\\nMrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor\\nwished to spread as little as possible intelligence\\nthat had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such\\nsimple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy,\\nfor the sake of her own consequence, would choose\\nto have known.  The continuance of their engagement,\\nand the means that were able to be taken for promoting\\nits end, was all her communication; and this produced\\nfrom Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.\\n\\n\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how\\nTHAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding\\nno good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty\\npounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,\\nand what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can\\ngive her.--Then they will have a child every year! and\\nLord help \\'em! how poor they will be!--I must see\\nwhat I can give them towards furnishing their house.\\nTwo maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t\\'other\\nday.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.--\\nBetty\\'s sister would never do for them NOW.\"\\n\\nThe next morning brought Elinor a letter by the\\ntwo-penny post from Lucy herself.  It was as follows:\\n\\n                    \"Bartlett\\'s Building, March.\\n\\n     \"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the\\n     liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your\\n     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such\\n     a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after\\n     all the troubles we have went through lately,\\n     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed\\n     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered\\n     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy\\n     as we must always be in one another\\'s love.  We have\\n     had great trials, and great persecutions, but\\n     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge\\n     many friends, yourself not the least among them,\\n     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully\\n     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of\\n     it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise\\n     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with\\n     him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our\\n     parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my\\n     duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,\\n     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would\\n     he consent to it; but he said it should never be,\\n     he did not regard his mother\\'s anger, while he could\\n     have my affections; our prospects are not very\\n     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for\\n     the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should\\n     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any\\n     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you\\n     will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,\\n     trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John,\\n     or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to\\n     assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what\\n     she did, but she did it for the best, so I say\\n     nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won\\'t think it too much\\n     trouble to give us a call, should she come this way\\n     any morning, \\'twould be a great kindness, and my\\n     cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds\\n     me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully\\n     and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John,\\n     and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you\\n     chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,\\n\\n                                      \"I am, &c.\"\\n\\nAs soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed\\nwhat she concluded to be its writer\\'s real design,\\nby placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it\\naloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.\\n\\n\"Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye,\\nthat was quite proper to let him be off if he would.\\nThat was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get\\nhim a living, with all my heart.--She calls me dear\\nMrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a good-hearted girl\\nas ever lived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence\\nis very prettily turned.  Yes, yes, I will go and see her,\\nsure enough.  How attentive she is, to think of every\\nbody!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is\\nas pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy\\'s head\\nand heart great credit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 39\\n\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than\\ntwo months in town, and Marianne\\'s impatience to be gone\\nincreased every day.  She sighed for the air, the liberty,\\nthe quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place\\ncould give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much\\nless bent on its being effected immediately, as that she\\nwas conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,\\nwhich Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.\\nShe began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards\\nits accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes\\nto their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the\\neloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,\\nwhich, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\\nlonger, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible\\nthan any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland\\nabout the end of March, for the Easter holidays;\\nand Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very\\nwarm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.  This would\\nnot, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of\\nMiss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real\\npoliteness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very\\ngreat amendment of his manners towards them since her\\nsister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept\\nit with pleasure.\\n\\nWhen she told Marianne what she had done, however,\\nher first reply was not very auspicious.\\n\\n\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation.\\n\"No, I cannot go to Cleveland.\"--\\n\\n\"You forget,\" said Elinor gently, \"that its situation\\nis not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of...\"\\n\\n\"But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go\\ninto Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward\\nto going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.\"\\n\\nElinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\\nsuch feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by\\nworking on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure\\nwhich would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,\\nwhom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,\\nmore comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,\\nand perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,\\nwhich was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to\\nBarton was not beyond one day, though a long day\\'s journey;\\nand their mother\\'s servant might easily come there to attend\\nthem down; and as there could be no occasion of their\\nstaying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at\\nhome in little more than three weeks\\' time.  As Marianne\\'s\\naffection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph\\nwith little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,\\nthat she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again\\nfrom Cleveland.  Elinor was grateful for the attention,\\nbut it could not alter her design; and their mother\\'s\\nconcurrence being readily gained, every thing relative\\nto their return was arranged as far as it could be;--\\nand Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement\\nof the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.\\n\\n\"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall\\ndo without the Miss Dashwoods;\"--was Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\naddress to him when he first called on her, after their\\nleaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved\\nupon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we\\nshall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape\\nat one another as dull as two cats.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous\\nsketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make\\nthat offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--\\nand if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think\\nher object gained; for, on Elinor\\'s moving to the window\\nto take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,\\nwhich she was going to copy for her friend, he followed\\nher to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed\\nwith her there for several minutes.  The effect of his\\ndiscourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,\\nfor though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\\nchanged her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,\\nto one close by the piano forte on which Marianne\\nwas playing, she could not keep herself from seeing\\nthat Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,\\nand was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--\\nStill farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval\\nof Marianne\\'s turning from one lesson to another,\\nsome words of the Colonel\\'s inevitably reached her ear,\\nin which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\\nof his house.  This set the matter beyond a doubt.\\nShe wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary\\nto do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.\\nWhat Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,\\nbut judged from the motion of her lips, that she did\\nnot think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings\\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest.\\nThey then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\\ncatching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne\\'s\\nperformance brought her these words in the Colonel\\'s calm voice,--\\n\\n\"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\\n\\nAstonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech,\\nshe was almost ready to cry out, \"Lord! what should\\nhinder it?\"--but checking her desire, confined herself\\nto this silent ejaculation.\\n\\n\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\\n\\nThis delay on the Colonel\\'s side, however, did not\\nseem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,\\nfor on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,\\nand moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard\\nElinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,\\n\\n\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,\\nand only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,\\nthe Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he\\nimmediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away\\nwithout making her any reply!--She had not thought her old\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\\n\\nWhat had really passed between them was to this effect.\\n\\n\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion,\\n\"of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered\\nfrom his family; for if I understand the matter right,\\nhe has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\\nin his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--\\nHave I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--\"\\n\\nElinor told him that it was.\\n\\n\"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied,\\nwith great feeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide,\\ntwo young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--\\nMrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what\\nshe may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr. Ferrars two\\nor three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased\\nwith him.  He is not a young man with whom one can\\nbe intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have\\nseen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,\\nand as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.\\nI understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you\\nbe so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,\\nnow just vacant, as I am informed by this day\\'s post,\\nis his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,\\nperhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,\\nit may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it\\nwere more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;\\nthe late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than\\n200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable\\nof improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as\\nto afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,\\nhowever, my pleasure in presenting him to it,\\nwill be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s astonishment at this commission could\\nhardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really\\nmaking her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,\\nwhich only two days before she had considered as hopeless\\nfor Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--\\nand SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to\\nbestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had\\nattributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor\\nfeelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share\\nin that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship,\\nwhich together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,\\nwere strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him\\nfor it with all her heart, spoke of Edward\\'s principles and\\ndisposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;\\nand promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,\\nif it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\nto another.  But at the same time, she could not help\\nthinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.\\nIt was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\\nEdward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,\\nshe would have been very glad to be spared herself;--\\nbut Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,\\ndeclining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being\\ngiven through her means, that she would not on any account\\nmake farther opposition.  Edward, she believed, was still in\\ntown,\\nand fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.\\nShe could undertake therefore to inform him of it,\\nin the course of the day.  After this had been settled,\\nColonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage\\nin securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,\\nand THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the\\nhouse was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,\\nas Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,\\nat least as far as regarded its size.\\n\\n\"The smallness of the house,\" said she,\\n\"I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,\\nfor it will be in proportion to their family and income.\"\\n\\nBy which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE\\nwas considering Mr. Ferrars\\'s marriage as the certain\\nconsequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it\\npossible that Delaford living could supply such an income,\\nas anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--\\nand he said so.\\n\\n\"This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars\\ncomfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.\\nI am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;\\nand my interest is hardly more extensive.  If, however,\\nby an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve\\nhim farther, I must think very differently of him\\nfrom what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful\\nto him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.\\nWhat I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,\\nsince it can advance him so little towards what must\\nbe his principal, his only object of happiness.\\nHis marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,\\nI am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--\"\\n\\nSuch was the sentence which, when misunderstood,\\nso justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;\\nbut after this narration of what really passed between\\nColonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window,\\nthe gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may\\nperhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from\\nan offer of marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 40\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\\nsagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,\\n\"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;\\nfor though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,\\nI could not help catching enough to understand his business.\\nAnd I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,\\nand I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Elinor.  \"It is a matter\\nof great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel\\nBrandon most sensibly.  There are not many men who would\\nact as he has done.  Few people who have so compassionate\\na heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an\\'t the least\\nastonished at it in the world, for I have often thought\\nof late, there was nothing more likely to happen.\"\\n\\n\"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel\\'s\\ngeneral benevolence; but at least you could not foresee\\nthat the opportunity would so very soon occur.\"\\n\\n\"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that,\\nwhen a man has once made up his mind to such a thing,\\nsomehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.\\nWell, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again;\\nand if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think\\nI shall soon know where to look for them.\"\\n\\n\"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\"\\nsaid Elinor, with a faint smile.\\n\\n\"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house\\nbeing a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at,\\nfor it is as good a one as ever I saw.\"\\n\\n\"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it?--\\nwho should do it but himself?\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the servant\\'s coming in to\\nannounce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings\\nimmediately preparing to go, said,--\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half\\nmy talk out.  But, however, we may have it all over in\\nthe evening; for we shall be quite alone.  I do not ask\\nyou to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full\\nof the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\\nlong to tell your sister all about it.\"\\n\\nMarianne had left the room before the conversation began.\\n\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am, I shall tell Marianne of it;\\nbut I shall not mention it at present to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very well,\" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.\\n\"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think\\nof going as far as Holborn to-day.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, not even Lucy if you please.\\nOne day\\'s delay will not be very material; and till I\\nhave written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be\\nmentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.\\nIt is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to\\nhis ordination.\"\\n\\nThis speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.\\nWhy Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it\\nin such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.\\nA few moments\\' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,\\nand she exclaimed;--\\n\\n\"Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be\\nthe man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure,\\nhe must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad\\nto find things are so forward between you.  But, my dear,\\nis not this rather out of character?  Should not the Colonel\\nwrite himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\"\\n\\nElinor did not quite understand the beginning of\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s speech, neither did she think it worth\\ninquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather\\nwished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars\\nthan himself.\"\\n\\n\"And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd\\nkind of delicacy!  However, I will not disturb you (seeing\\nher preparing to write.)  You know your own concerns best.\\nSo goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of any thing to\\nplease me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.\"\\n\\nAnd away she went; but returning again in a moment,\\n\\n\"I have just been thinking of Betty\\'s sister, my dear.\\nI should be very glad to get her so good a mistress.\\nBut whether she would do for a lady\\'s maid, I am sure I\\ncan\\'t tell.  She is an excellent housemaid, and works\\nvery well at her needle.  However, you will think of all\\nthat at your leisure.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, ma\\'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing\\nmuch of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,\\nthan to be mistress of the subject.\\n\\nHow she should begin--how she should express\\nherself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern.\\nThe particular circumstances between them made\\na difficulty of that which to any other person would\\nhave been the easiest thing in the world; but she\\nequally feared to say too much or too little, and sat\\ndeliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,\\ntill broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\\n\\nHe had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to\\nthe carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she,\\nafter apologising for not returning herself, had obliged\\nhim to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,\\nand wanted to speak with him on very particular business.\\n\\nElinor had just been congratulating herself,\\nin the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it\\nmight be to express herself properly by letter, it was\\nat least preferable to giving the information by word\\nof mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this\\ngreatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had\\nnot seen him before since his engagement became public,\\nand therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\\nwith it; which, with the consciousness of what she\\nhad been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,\\nmade her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.\\nHe too was much distressed; and they sat down together\\nin a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he\\nhad asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\\ninto the room, he could not recollect; but determining\\nto be on the safe side, he made his apology in form\\nas soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished\\nto speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I\\ncertainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;\\nthough at the same time, I should have been extremely\\nsorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\\nespecially as it will most likely be some time--it\\nis not probable that I should soon have the pleasure\\nof meeting you again.  I go to Oxford tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor,\\nrecovering herself, and determined to get over what she\\nso much dreaded as soon as possible, \"without receiving\\nour good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them\\nin person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.\\nI have something of consequence to inform you of,\\nwhich I was on the point of communicating by paper.\\nI am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing\\nrather faster than usual as she spoke.)  Colonel Brandon,\\nwho was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,\\nthat understanding you mean to take orders, he has\\ngreat pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford\\nnow just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.\\nAllow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\\nand well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\\nthe living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much\\nmore considerable, and such as might better enable you\\nto--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to\\nyourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views\\nof happiness.\"\\n\\nWhat Edward felt, as he could not say it himself,\\nit cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.\\nHe LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,\\nsuch unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;\\nbut he said only these two words,\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,\\nas some of the worst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means\\nit as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\\npassed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\\nconduct of your family has placed you--a concern\\nwhich I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,\\nmust share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\\nfor your general character, and his particular approbation\\nof your behaviour on the present occasion.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"The unkindness of your own relations has made you\\nastonished to find friendship any where.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to\\nfind it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you,\\nto your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express\\nit if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator.\"\\n\\n\"You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you\\nthat you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,\\nto your own merit, and Colonel Brandon\\'s discernment\\nof it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,\\ntill I understood his design, that the living was vacant;\\nnor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\\nhad such a living in his gift.  As a friend of mine,\\nof my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,\\nyou owe nothing to my solicitation.\"\\n\\nTruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\\nin the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling\\nto appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged\\nit with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix\\nthat suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.\\nFor a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased\\nto speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.\\nI have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother\\nI know esteems him highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man,\\nand in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him,\\non farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,\\nand as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand\\nthe parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)\\nit is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this.\"\\n\\nEdward made no answer; but when she had turned\\naway her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,\\nso uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish\\nthe distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house\\nmuch greater.\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\"\\nsaid he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.\\n\\nElinor told him the number of the house.\\n\\n\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks\\nwhich you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him\\nthat he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man.\"\\n\\nElinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted,\\nwith a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing\\ngood wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\\nthat might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to\\nreturn the same good will, than the power of expressing it.\\n\\n\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself,\\nas the door shut him out, \"I shall see him the husband\\nof Lucy.\"\\n\\nAnd with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down\\nto reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour\\nto comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,\\nto reflect on her own with discontent.\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned\\nfrom seeing people whom she had never seen before,\\nand of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,\\nher mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\\nin her possession, than by anything else, that she\\nreverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up to the\\nyoung man.  Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had\\nno great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling\\nto accept your proposal?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am; THAT was not very likely.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems\\nall to depend upon that.\"\\n\\n\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind\\nof forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time,\\nor the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three\\nmonths will complete his ordination.\"\\n\\n\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear,\\nhow calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two\\nor three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME\\nquite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad\\nto do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is\\nnot worth while to wait two or three months for him.\\nSure somebody else might be found that would do as well;\\nsomebody that is in orders already.\"\\n\\n\"My dear ma\\'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--\\nWhy, Colonel Brandon\\'s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade\\nme that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\\nten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!\"\\n\\nThe deception could not continue after this;\\nand an explanation immediately took place, by which both\\ngained considerable amusement for the moment, without any\\nmaterial loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings\\nonly exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\\nwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she,\\nafter the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\\nwas over, \"and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear\\na man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my\\nknowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I\\nthink the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--\\nand to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!--\\nIt seems quite ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must\\ntouch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,\\nand make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it.\"\\n\\n\"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea\\nof the living\\'s being enough to allow them to marry.\"\\n\\n\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two\\nthousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry\\non less.  Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall\\nbe paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas;\\nand I am sure I sha\\'nt go if Lucy an\\'t there.\"\\n\\nElinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability\\nof their not waiting for any thing more.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 41\\n\\n\\nEdward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon,\\nproceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the\\nexcess of it by the time he reached Bartlett\\'s Buildings,\\nthat she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called\\non her again the next day with her congratulations,\\nthat she had never seen him in such spirits before\\nin her life.\\n\\nHer own happiness, and her own spirits, were at\\nleast very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most\\nheartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably\\ntogether in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.\\nSo far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness\\nto give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her,\\nthat she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most\\ngrateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation\\nto her, and openly declared that no exertion for their\\ngood on Miss Dashwood\\'s part, either present or future,\\nwould ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of\\ndoing any thing in the world for those she really valued.\\nAs for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship\\nhim as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that\\nhe should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;\\nanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost;\\nand scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford,\\nas far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage,\\nhis cows, and his poultry.\\n\\nIt was now above a week since John Dashwood had\\ncalled in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no notice\\nhad been taken by them of his wife\\'s indisposition,\\nbeyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it\\nnecessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation,\\nhowever, which not only opposed her own inclination,\\nbut which had not the assistance of any encouragement\\nfrom her companions.  Marianne, not contented with\\nabsolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent\\nto prevent her sister\\'s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,\\nthough her carriage was always at Elinor\\'s service,\\nso very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her\\ncuriosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,\\nnor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward\\'s part,\\ncould overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.\\nThe consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself\\nto pay a visit, for which no one could really have\\nless inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete\\nwith a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\\nreason to dislike.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could\\nturn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.\\nHe expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her\\nthat he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street,\\nand, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,\\ninvited her to come in.\\n\\nThey walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.\\n\\n\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I\\nwill go to her presently, for I am sure she will not\\nhave the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.--\\nVery far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there\\ncannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always\\ngreat favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\"--\\n\\nElinor made what excuse she could for her.\\n\\n\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied,\\n\"for I have a good deal to say to you.  This living\\nof Colonel Brandon\\'s--can it be true?--has he really given\\nit to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\\n\\n\"It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given\\nthe living of Delaford to Edward.\"\\n\\n\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no\\nrelationship!--no connection between them!--and now\\nthat livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?\"\\n\\n\"About two hundred a year.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living\\nof that value--supposing the late incumbent to have\\nbeen old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he\\nmight have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.\\nAnd how came he not to have settled that matter before this\\nperson\\'s death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it,\\nbut a man of Colonel Brandon\\'s sense!--I wonder he should\\nbe so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,\\nconcern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal\\nof inconsistency in almost every human character.  I suppose,\\nhowever--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS.\\nEdward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\\nthe Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough\\nto take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\\n\\nElinor contradicted it, however, very positively;\\nand by relating that she had herself been employed\\nin conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward,\\nand, therefore, must understand the terms on which it\\nwas given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\\n\\n\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing\\nwhat she said--\"what could be the Colonel\\'s motive?\"\\n\\n\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,\\nEdward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter\\nto Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her,\\nand she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear\\nit much talked of.\"\\n\\nElinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing,\\nthat she thought Fanny might have borne with composure,\\nan acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither\\nshe nor her child could be possibly impoverished.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the\\ntone becoming so important a subject, \"knows nothing\\nabout it at present, and I believe it will be best to\\nkeep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--\\nWhen the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear\\nof it all.\"\\n\\n\"But why should such precaution be used?--Though\\nit is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have\\nthe smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\\nmoney enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite\\nout of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,\\nis she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her\\nson, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those\\nover whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.\\nSurely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\\nto any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--\\nshe cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--\\nShe would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\\nof a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good,\\nbut it is founded on ignorance of human nature.\\nWhen Edward\\'s unhappy match takes place, depend upon it\\nhis mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;\\nand, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\\ndreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\\nMrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\\n\\n\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly\\nhave escaped her memory by THIS time.\"\\n\\n\"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one\\nof the most affectionate mothers in the world.\"\\n\\nElinor was silent.\\n\\n\"We think NOW,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause,\\n\"of ROBERT\\'S marrying Miss Morton.\"\\n\\nElinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance\\nof her brother\\'s tone, calmly replied,\\n\\n\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner\\nof speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether\\nshe marry Edward or Robert.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert\\nwill now to all intents and purposes be considered\\nas the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are\\nboth very agreeable young men: I do not know that one\\nis superior to the other.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more, and John was also for a short\\ntime silent.--His reflections ended thus.\\n\\n\"Of ONE thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand,\\nand speaking in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you;--\\nand I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you.\\nI have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the\\nbest authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but\\nI have it from the very best authority--not that I ever\\nprecisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her\\ndaughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short,\\nwhatever objections there might be against a certain--a\\ncertain connection--you understand me--it would have been\\nfar preferable to her, it would not have given her half\\nthe vexation that THIS does.  I was exceedingly pleased\\nto hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--\\na very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.\\n\\'It would have been beyond comparison,\\' she said, \\'the least\\nevil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW\\nfor nothing worse.\\' But however, all that is quite out\\nof the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--\\nas to any attachment you know--it never could be--all\\nthat is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you\\nof this, because I knew how much it must please you.\\nNot that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor.  There\\nis no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well,\\nor better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has Colonel\\nBrandon been with you lately?\"\\n\\nElinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity,\\nand raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves\\nand fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be\\nspared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,\\nand from the danger of hearing any thing more from\\nher brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.\\nAfter a few moments\\' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that\\nFanny was yet uninformed of her sister\\'s being there,\\nquitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left\\nto improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the\\ngay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner\\nwhile enjoying so unfair a division of his mother\\'s love\\nand liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,\\nearned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that\\nbrother\\'s integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable\\nopinion of his head and heart.\\n\\nThey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,\\nbefore he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard\\nof the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject.\\nElinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them\\nto John; and their effect on Robert, though very different,\\nwas not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed\\nmost immoderately.  The idea of Edward\\'s being a clergyman,\\nand living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him\\nbeyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful\\nimagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice,\\nand publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and\\nMary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\\n\\nElinor, while she waited in silence and immovable\\ngravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain\\nher eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke\\nall the contempt it excited.  It was a look, however,\\nvery well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave\\nno intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\\nnot by any reproof of her\\'s, but by his own sensibility.\\n\\n\"We may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last,\\nrecovering from the affected laugh which had considerably\\nlengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--\"but, upon\\nmy soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor Edward!\\nhe is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--\\nfor I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as\\nwell-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.\\nYou must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR\\nslight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly\\nnot the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born,\\nyou know, with the same powers,--the same address.--\\nPoor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--\\nto be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,\\nI believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;\\nand I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my\\nlife, as when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.--\\nMy mother was the first person who told me of it;\\nand I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\\nimmediately said to her, \\'My dear madam, I do not know\\nwhat you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself,\\nI must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman,\\nI never will see him again.\\' That was what I said immediately.--\\nI was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has\\ndone for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from\\nall decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother,\\nI am not in the least surprised at it; from his style\\nof education, it was always to be expected.  My poor mother\\nwas half frantic.\"\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen the lady?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house,\\nI happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw\\nquite enough of her.  The merest awkward country girl,\\nwithout style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--\\nI remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I\\nshould suppose likely to captivate poor Edward.\\nI offered immediately, as soon as my mother related\\nthe affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade\\nhim from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found,\\nto do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way\\nat first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach\\nhad taken place, when it was not for me, you know,\\nto interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few\\nhours earlier--I think it is most probable--that something\\nmight have been hit on.  I certainly should have represented\\nit to Edward in a very strong light.  \\'My dear fellow,\\'\\nI should have said, \\'consider what you are doing.\\nYou are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one\\nas your family are unanimous in disapproving.\\' I cannot\\nhelp thinking, in short, that means might have been found.\\nBut now it is all too late.  He must be starved, you know;--\\nthat is certain; absolutely starved.\"\\n\\nHe had just settled this point with great composure,\\nwhen the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the\\nsubject.\\nBut though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family,\\nElinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something\\nlike confusion of countenance with which she entered,\\nand an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.\\nShe even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find\\nthat Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town,\\nas she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion\\nin which her husband, who attended her into the room,\\nand hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish\\nevery thing that was most affectionate and graceful.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 42\\n\\n\\nOne other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor\\nreceived her brother\\'s congratulations on their travelling\\nso far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two,\\ncompleted the intercourse of the brother and sisters\\nin town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come\\nto Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way,\\nwhich of all things was the most unlikely to occur,\\nwith a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John\\nto Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come\\nto see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting\\nin the country.\\n\\nIt amused her to observe that all her friends seemed\\ndetermined to send her to Delaford;--a place, in which,\\nof all others, she would now least chuse to visit,\\nor wish to reside; for not only was it considered as\\nher future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy,\\nwhen they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.\\n\\nVery early in April, and tolerably early in the day,\\nthe two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set\\nout from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,\\non the road.  For the convenience of Charlotte and her child,\\nthey were to be more than two days on their journey,\\nand Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon,\\nwas to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\\n\\nMarianne, few as had been her hours of comfort\\nin London, and eager as she had long been to quit it,\\ncould not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to\\nthe house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\\nthose hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby,\\nwhich were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.\\nNor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained,\\nbusy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE\\ncould have no share, without shedding many tears.\\n\\nElinor\\'s satisfaction, at the moment of removal,\\nwas more positive.  She had no such object for her lingering\\nthoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom\\nit would give her a moment\\'s regret to be divided for ever,\\nshe was pleased to be free herself from the persecution\\nof Lucy\\'s friendship, she was grateful for bringing\\nher sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage,\\nand she looked forward with hope to what a few months\\nof tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring\\nMarianne\\'s peace of mind, and confirming her own.\\n\\nTheir journey was safely performed.  The second\\nday brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited,\\ncounty of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns\\nin Marianne\\'s imagination; and in the forenoon of the third\\nthey drove up to Cleveland.\\n\\nCleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,\\nsituated on a sloping lawn.  It had no park, but the\\npleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like\\nevery other place of the same degree of importance,\\nit had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk,\\na road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,\\nled to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber,\\nthe house itself was under the guardianship of the fir,\\nthe mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of\\nthem altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,\\nshut out the offices.\\n\\nMarianne entered the house with a heart swelling\\nwith emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty\\nmiles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;\\nand before she had been five minutes within its walls,\\nwhile the others were busily helping Charlotte to show\\nher child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again,\\nstealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just\\nbeginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence;\\nwhere, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over\\na wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly\\nrest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon,\\nand fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen.\\n\\nIn such moments of precious, invaluable misery,\\nshe rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland;\\nand as she returned by a different circuit to the house,\\nfeeling all the happy privilege of country liberty,\\nof wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude,\\nshe resolved to spend almost every hour of every day\\nwhile she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of\\nsuch solitary rambles.\\n\\nShe returned just in time to join the others\\nas they quitted the house, on an excursion through its\\nmore immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was\\neasily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden,\\nexamining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the\\ngardener\\'s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through\\nthe green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,\\nunwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,\\nraised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her\\npoultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her\\ndairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being\\nstolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\\nyoung brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\\n\\nThe morning was fine and dry, and Marianne,\\nin her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated\\nfor any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland.\\nWith great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented\\nby a settled rain from going out again after dinner.\\nShe had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple,\\nand perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely\\ncold or damp would not have deterred her from it;\\nbut a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry\\nor pleasant weather for walking.\\n\\nTheir party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.\\nMrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work;\\nthey talked of the friends they had left behind,\\narranged Lady Middleton\\'s engagements, and wondered\\nwhether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\\nthan Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned\\nin it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had\\nthe knack of finding her way in every house to the library,\\nhowever it might be avoided by the family in general,\\nsoon procured herself a book.\\n\\nNothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer\\'s side that constant\\nand friendly good humour could do, to make them feel\\nthemselves welcome.  The openness and heartiness of her\\nmanner more than atoned for that want of recollection\\nand elegance which made her often deficient in the forms\\nof politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty\\na face, was engaging; her folly, though evident\\nwas not disgusting, because it was not conceited;\\nand Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very\\nlate dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,\\nand a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a\\nlong morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.\\n\\nElinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that\\nlittle had seen so much variety in his address to her\\nsister and herself, that she knew not what to expect\\nto find him in his own family.  She found him, however,\\nperfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother;\\nshe found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,\\nand only prevented from being so always, by too great\\nan aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people\\nin general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings\\nand Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits,\\nthey were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive,\\nwith no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.\\nHe was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;\\nfond of his child, though affecting to slight it;\\nand idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought\\nto have been devoted to business.  She liked him, however,\\nupon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in\\nher heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--\\nnot sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism,\\nhis selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency\\non the remembrance of Edward\\'s generous temper, simple taste,\\nand diffident feelings.\\n\\nOf Edward, or at least of some of his concerns,\\nshe now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon,\\nwho had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who,\\ntreating her at once as the disinterested friend\\nof Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,\\ntalked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford,\\ndescribed its deficiencies, and told her what he meant\\nto do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour\\nto her in this, as well as in every other particular,\\nhis open pleasure in meeting her after an absence\\nof only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,\\nand his deference for her opinion, might very well\\njustify Mrs. Jennings\\'s persuasion of his attachment,\\nand would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,\\nas from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite,\\nto make her suspect it herself.  But as it was,\\nsuch a notion had scarcely ever entered her head,\\nexcept by Mrs. Jennings\\'s suggestion; and she could\\nnot help believing herself the nicest observer of the\\ntwo;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought\\nonly of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious\\nsolicitude on Marianne\\'s feeling, in her head and throat,\\nthe beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\\nentirely escaped the latter lady\\'s observation;--SHE could\\ndiscover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm\\nof a lover.\\n\\nTwo delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth\\nevenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel\\nof the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially\\nin the most distant parts of them, where there was something\\nmore of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were\\nthe oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\\nhad--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting\\nin her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold\\nso violent as, though for a day or two trifled with\\nor denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on\\nthe concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\\nPrescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual,\\nwere all declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain\\nin her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night\\'s\\nrest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty\\nthat Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed,\\nto try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 43\\n\\n\\nMarianne got up the next morning at her usual time;\\nto every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to\\nprove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.\\nBut a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire\\nwith a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,\\nor in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak\\nmuch in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,\\nshe went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel\\nBrandon was only astonished at her sister\\'s composure,\\nwho, though attending and nursing her the whole day,\\nagainst Marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines\\non her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty\\nand efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.\\n\\nA very restless and feverish night, however,\\ndisappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne,\\nafter persisting in rising, confessed herself unable\\nto sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,\\nElinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings\\'s advice,\\nof sending for the Palmers\\' apothecary.\\n\\nHe came, examined his patient, and though encouraging\\nMiss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore\\nher sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder\\nto have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word \"infection\"\\nto pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,\\non her baby\\'s account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined\\nfrom the first to think Marianne\\'s complaint more serious\\nthan Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris\\'s report,\\nand confirming Charlotte\\'s fears and caution, urged the\\nnecessity of her immediate removal with her infant;\\nand Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,\\nfound the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great\\nto be withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;\\nand within an hour after Mr. Harris\\'s arrival, she set off,\\nwith her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a\\nnear relation of Mr. Palmer\\'s, who lived a few miles\\non the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised,\\nat her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;\\nand whither she was almost equally urgent with her\\nmother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings, however, with a\\nkindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,\\ndeclared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland\\nas long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\\nby her own attentive care, to supply to her the place\\nof the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her\\non every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,\\ndesirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her\\nbetter experience in nursing, of material use.\\n\\nPoor Marianne, languid and low from the nature\\nof her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,\\ncould no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;\\nand the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,\\nbut for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;\\nfor on that day they were to have begun their journey home;\\nand, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,\\nwere to have taken their mother by surprise on the\\nfollowing forenoon.  The little she said was all in\\nlamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried\\nto raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN\\nreally believed herself, that it would be a very short one.\\n\\nThe next day produced little or no alteration in the\\nstate of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,\\nexcept that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.\\nTheir party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,\\nthough very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\nand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be\\nfrightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last\\nby Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;\\nand while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,\\nwith a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\\nlikewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings\\ninterposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away\\nwhile his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister\\'s\\naccount, would be to deprive them both, she thought,\\nof every comfort; and therefore telling him at once\\nthat his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,\\nthat she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,\\nwhile Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she\\nurged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying\\nthe first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\\nlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nentreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed\\nto feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person\\nso well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.\\n\\nMarianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all\\nthese arrangements.  She knew not that she had been\\nthe means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,\\nin about seven days from the time of their arrival.\\nIt gave her no surprise that she saw nothing\\nof Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,\\nshe never mentioned her name.\\n\\nTwo days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer\\'s departure,\\nand her situation continued, with little variation,\\nthe same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,\\nstill talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood\\nwas equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined\\nvery early in the seizure that Marianne would never\\nget over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly\\nof use in listening to Mrs. Jennings\\'s forebodings,\\nwas not in a state of mind to resist their influence.\\nHe tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different\\njudgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;\\nbut the many hours of each day in which he was left\\nentirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission\\nof every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from\\nhis mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\\n\\nOn the morning of the third day however, the gloomy\\nanticipations of both were almost done away; for when\\nMr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.\\nHer pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable\\nthan on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every\\npleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that\\nin her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own\\njudgment rather than her friend\\'s, in making very light\\nof the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;\\nand almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be\\nable to travel.\\n\\nBut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--\\nTowards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing\\nmore heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.\\nHer sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to\\nattribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\\nof having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully\\nadministering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with\\nsatisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which\\nshe expected the most beneficial effects.  Her sleep,\\nthough not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,\\nlasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe\\nthe result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her\\nduring the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing\\nof any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;\\nher maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\\nherself in the housekeeper\\'s room, and Elinor remained\\nalone with Marianne.\\n\\nThe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;\\nand her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention\\nher continual change of posture, and heard the frequent\\nbut inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,\\nwas almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,\\nwhen Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\\nin the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,\\ncried out,--\\n\\n\"Is mama coming?--\"\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,\\nand assisting Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will\\nbe here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a great way,\\nyou know, from hence to Barton.\"\\n\\n\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,\\nin the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,\\nif she goes by London.\"\\n\\nElinor perceived with alarm that she was not\\nquite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,\\neagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker than ever!\\nand Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm\\nincreased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending\\ninstantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger\\nto Barton for her mother.  To consult with Colonel Brandon\\non the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought\\nwhich immediately followed the resolution of its performance;\\nand as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\\nby her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,\\nwhere she knew he was generally to be found at a much\\nlater hour than the present.\\n\\nIt was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her\\ndifficulties were immediately before him.  Her fears,\\nhe had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--\\nhe listened to them in silent despondence;--but her\\ndifficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness\\nthat seemed to speak the occasion, and the service\\npre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the\\nmessenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  Elinor made no\\nresistance that was not easily overcome.  She thanked him\\nwith brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went\\nto hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and\\nan order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines\\nto her mother.\\n\\nThe comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel\\nBrandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully\\nwas it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,\\nwhose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might\\nsoothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD\\nbe lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\\nwould lessen it.\\n\\nHE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all\\nthe firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary\\narrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated\\nwith exactness the time in which she might look for\\nhis return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.\\nThe horses arrived, even before they were expected,\\nand Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look\\nof solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,\\nhurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve\\no\\'clock, and she returned to her sister\\'s apartment to wait\\nfor the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her\\nthe rest of the night.  It was a night of almost equal\\nsuffering to both.  Hour after hour passed away in sleepless\\npain and delirium on Marianne\\'s side, and in the most\\ncruel anxiety on Elinor\\'s, before Mr. Harris appeared.\\nHer apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all\\nher former security; and the servant who sat up with her,\\nfor she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,\\nonly tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress\\nhad always thought.\\n\\nMarianne\\'s ideas were still, at intervals,\\nfixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she\\nmentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of\\npoor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled\\nwith so many days of illness, and wretched for some\\nimmediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon\\nbe in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,\\nand pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving\\ntoo late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\\n\\nShe was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,\\nor if HE could not come, for some other advice,\\nwhen the former--but not till after five o\\'clock--arrived.\\nHis opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,\\nfor though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\\nalteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger\\nto be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh\\nmode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,\\nin a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.  He promised\\nto call again in the course of three or four hours,\\nand left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\\ncomposed than he had found them.\\n\\nWith strong concern, and with many reproaches for not\\nbeing called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the\\nmorning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,\\nnow with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of\\nthe event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\\nher conviction of her sister\\'s danger would not allow her\\nto offer the comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.\\nThe rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,\\nso lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested\\nperson with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings\\'s compassion\\nshe had other claims.  She had been for three months\\nher companion, was still under her care, and she was\\nknown to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.\\nThe distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,\\nwas before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\\nconsidered that Marianne might probably be to HER what\\nCharlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings\\nwas very sincere.\\n\\nMr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--\\nbut he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the\\nlast would produce.  His medicines had failed;--the fever\\nwas unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more\\nherself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching all,\\nand more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call\\nin further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had\\nstill something more to try, some more fresh application,\\nof whose success he was as confident as the last, and his\\nvisit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\\nthe ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.\\nShe was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\\nbut she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued\\ntill noon, scarcely stirring from her sister\\'s bed,\\nher thoughts wandering from one image of grief,\\none suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed\\nto the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\\nwho scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger\\nof this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition\\nwhich Marianne\\'s disappointment had brought on.\\nElinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it\\ngave fresh misery to her reflections.\\n\\nAbout noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a\\ndread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,\\neven to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive\\na slight amendment in her sister\\'s pulse;--she waited,\\nwatched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,\\nwith an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,\\nthan all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate\\nher hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,\\nto acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her\\nyoung friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--\\nand Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,\\ntold herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.\\nHope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,\\nshe bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.\\nHalf an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom\\nyet blessed her.  Others even arose to confirm it.\\nHer breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor\\nwith signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on\\nher with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and\\nhope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no\\nmoment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at\\nfour o\\'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\\na recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,\\ngave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\\n\\nMarianne was in every respect materially better,\\nand he declared her entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,\\nperhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her\\nforebodings which had been found in their late alarm,\\nallowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\\nwith unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,\\nthe probability of an entire recovery.\\n\\nElinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a\\ndifferent kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.\\nMarianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her\\ndoting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations\\nof exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--\\nbut it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\\nno smiles.  All within Elinor\\'s breast was satisfaction,\\nsilent and strong.\\n\\nShe continued by the side of her sister, with little\\nintermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,\\nsatisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,\\nsupplying every succour, and watching almost every look and\\nevery breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,\\nin some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--\\nbut when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,\\nthat every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne\\nat six o\\'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\\nappearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\\n\\nThe time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon\\nmight be expected back.  At ten o\\'clock, she trusted,\\nor at least not much later her mother would be relieved\\nfrom the dreadful suspense in which she must now be\\ntravelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\\nless an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress\\nof time which yet kept them in ignorance!\\n\\nAt seven o\\'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep,\\nshe joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.\\nOf breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of\\ndinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--\\nand the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings\\nof content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.\\nMrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,\\nto take some rest before her mother\\'s arrival, and allow HER to\\ntake her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,\\nno capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was\\nnot to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.\\nMrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the\\nsick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts,\\nand retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.\\n\\nThe night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared\\nround the house, and the rain beat against the windows;\\nbut Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.\\nMarianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--\\nthey had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.\\n\\nThe clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,\\nElinor would have been convinced that at that moment\\nshe heard a carriage driving up to the house;\\nand so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite\\nof the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,\\nthat she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and\\nopened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.\\nShe instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.\\nThe flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\\nBy their uncertain light she thought she could discern it\\nto be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the\\nexcess of her poor mother\\'s alarm, gave some explanation\\nto such unexpected rapidity.\\n\\nNever in her life had Elinor found it so difficult\\nto be calm, as at that moment.  The knowledge of what her\\nmother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--\\nof her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and\\nof what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was\\nimpossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done\\nwas to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till\\nshe could leave Mrs. Jennings\\'s maid with her sister,\\nshe hurried down stairs.\\n\\nThe bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along\\nan inner lobby, assured her that they were already\\nin the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she\\nentered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 44\\n\\n\\nElinor, starting back with a look of horror at\\nthe sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart\\nin turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand\\nwas already on the lock, when its action was suspended\\nby his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather\\nof command than supplication,\\n\\n\"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--\\nI entreat you to stay.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall NOT stay.\\nYour business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,\\nforgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,\\n\"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,\\nit would not have turned me from the door.  My business\\nis with you, and only you.\"\\n\\n\"With me!\"--in the utmost amazement--\"well, sir,--\\nbe quick--and if you can--less violent.\"\\n\\n\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\\n\\nShe hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility\\nof Colonel Brandon\\'s arriving and finding her there,\\ncame across her.  But she had promised to hear him,\\nand her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.\\nAfter a moment\\'s recollection, therefore, concluding that\\nprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would\\nbest promote it, she walked silently towards the table,\\nand sat down.  He took the opposite chair, and for half\\na minute not a word was said by either.\\n\\n\"Pray be quick, sir,\"--said Elinor, impatiently;--\\n\"I have no time to spare.\"\\n\\nHe was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,\\nand seemed not to hear her.\\n\\n\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment\\nafterwards--\"is out of danger.  I heard it from the servant.\\nGod be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?\"\\n\\nElinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with\\nyet greater eagerness.\\n\\n\"For God\\'s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\\n\\n\"We hope she is.\"\\n\\nHe rose up, and walked across the room.\\n\\n\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But\\nsince I AM here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he\\nreturned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--For once,\\nMiss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us\\nbe cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--\\nTell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--\\n\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\\n\\nElinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.\\nShe began to think that be must be in liquor;--the\\nstrangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,\\nseemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression\\nshe immediately rose, saying,\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return\\nto Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--\\nWhatever your business may be with me, will it be better\\nrecollected and explained to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile,\\nand a voice perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk.--\\nA pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was\\nenough to over-set me.\"\\n\\n\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at\\na loss to understand what he would be at.\\n\\n\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o\\'clock,\\nand the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise\\nsince that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough.\"\\n\\nThe steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence\\nof his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever\\nother unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,\\nhe was not brought there by intoxication, she said,\\nafter a moment\\'s recollection,\\n\\n\"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly\\nDO--that after what has passed--your coming here in\\nthis manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,\\nrequires a very particular excuse.--What is it,\\nthat you mean by it?\"--\\n\\n\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can,\\nto make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.\\nI mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind\\nof apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,\\nand by convincing you, that though I have been always\\na blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain\\nsomething like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\"\\n\\n\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth\\nwhich brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,\\nand in spite of herself made her think him sincere.\\n\\n\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--\\nfor Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you.\"\\n\\n\"Has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--\\n\"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.\\nBut she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable\\ngrounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\"\\n\\nElinor bowed her assent.\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation\\non her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU\\nmay have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,\\nor what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--\\nPerhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\\nworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.\\nWhen I first became intimate in your family, I had no\\nother intention, no other view in the acquaintance\\nthan to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain\\nin Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\\nYour sister\\'s lovely person and interesting manners\\ncould not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost\\nfrom the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,\\nwhen I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my\\nheart should have been so insensible!  But at first\\nI must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.\\nCareless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,\\ngiving way to feelings which I had always been too much\\nin the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means\\nin my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\\ndesign of returning her affection.\"\\n\\nMiss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him\\nwith the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\\n\\n\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,\\nfor you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.\\nSuch a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--\\nDo not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on\\nthe subject.\"\\n\\n\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,\\n\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,\\nalways in the habit of associating with people of better\\nincome than myself.  Every year since my coming of age,\\nor even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though\\nthe death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;\\nyet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,\\nit had been for some time my intention to re-establish my\\ncircumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  To attach\\nmyself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be\\nthought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--\\nwhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,\\nMiss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting\\nin this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a\\nthought of returning it.--But one thing may be said\\nfor me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,\\nI did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,\\nbecause I did not THEN know what it was to love.\\nBut have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I\\nreally loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,\\nto avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--\\nBut I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,\\nwhich her affection and her society would have deprived\\nof all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\\n\\n\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,\\n\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"\\n\\n\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood\\nsuch tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have\\ndone it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,\\nsincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life\\nwere what I spent with her when I felt my intentions\\nwere strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.\\nEven THEN, however, when fully determined on paying\\nmy addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly\\nto put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\\nfrom an unwillingness to enter into an engagement\\nwhile my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.\\nI will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate\\non the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling\\nto engage my faith where my honour was already bound.\\nThe event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\\nproviding with great circumspection for a possible\\nopportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched\\nfor ever.  At last, however, my resolution was taken,\\nand I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,\\nto justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,\\nand openly assure her of an affection which I had already\\ntaken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the\\ninterim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I\\ncould have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--\\na circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin\\nall my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery\\ntook place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith\\nhad somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some\\ndistant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of\\nher favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not\\nexplain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an\\nheightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular\\nintimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"\\n\\n\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,\\nand hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,\\n\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any\\npart of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess\\nis beyond my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received\\nthe account.  Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge\\nthat her situation and her character ought to have been\\nrespected by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but at\\nthe same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing\\nto urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\\nand because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.\\nIf the violence of her passions, the weakness of her\\nunderstanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.\\nHer affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,\\nwith great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,\\nfor a very short time, had the power of creating any return.\\nI wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured\\nmore than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection\\nfor me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;\\nand whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"--\\n\\n\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate\\ngirl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion\\nof such a subject may well be--your indifference is no\\napology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do not think yourself\\nexcused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding\\non her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\\nYou must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself\\nin Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,\\nalways happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\\n\\n\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly\\nreplied; \"I did not recollect that I had omitted to give\\nher my direction; and common sense might have told her\\nhow to find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\\n\\n\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion\\nmay be guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality\\nof her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing\\nwas against me.  The matter itself I could not deny,\\nand vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was\\npreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my\\nconduct in general, and was moreover discontented with\\nthe very little attention, the very little portion of my\\ntime that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.\\nIn short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I\\nmight have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,\\ngood woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would\\nmarry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally\\ndismissed from her favour and her house.  The night\\nfollowing this affair--I was to go the next morning--\\nwas spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct\\nshould be.  The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.\\nMy affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her\\nattachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh\\nthat dread of poverty, or get the better of those false\\nideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally\\ninclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.\\nI had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,\\nif I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think\\nthat nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.\\nA heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave\\nDevonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;\\nsome apology was therefore necessary for my breaking\\nthis engagement.  But whether I should write this apology,\\nor deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.\\nTo see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted\\nwhether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.\\nIn that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,\\nas the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw\\nher miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping\\nnever to see her again.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor,\\nreproachfully; \"a note would have answered every purpose.--\\nWhy was it necessary to call?\"\\n\\n\"It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear\\nto leave the country in a manner that might lead you,\\nor the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part\\nof what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--\\nand I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,\\nin my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,\\nhowever, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,\\nI found her alone.  You were all gone I do not know where.\\nI had left her only the evening before, so fully,\\nso firmly resolved within my self on doing right!\\nA few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;\\nand I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I\\nwalked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,\\ndelighted with every body!  But in this, our last interview\\nof friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt\\nthat almost took from me the power of dissembling.\\nHer sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told\\nher that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I\\nnever shall forget it--united too with such reliance,\\nsuch confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted\\nrascal I was!\"\\n\\nThey were both silent for a few moments.\\nElinor first spoke.\\n\\n\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently;\\n\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all\\nlikelihood much more than was justified by the future.\\nI cannot think of it.--It won\\'t do.--Then came your dear mother\\nto torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.\\nThank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was miserable.\\nMiss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\ngives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge\\nto myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,\\nthat all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and\\nexultation to me now.  Well, I went, left all that I loved,\\nand went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.\\nMy journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\\nand therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my\\nown reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward\\nevery thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,\\nthe picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\"\\n\\nHe stopped.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him,\\ngrew impatient for his departure, \"and this is all?\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--\\nThat infamous letter--Did she shew it you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"\\n\\n\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did,\\nfor I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--\\nin the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more\\nsimple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--\\nmy feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word\\nwas--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,\\nwere she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.\\nTo know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--\\na thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof\\nwould she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe\\nthey are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure\\nthey are dearer.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart, which had undergone many changes\\nin the course of this extraordinary conversation,\\nwas now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check\\nsuch ideas in her companion as the last.\\n\\n\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that\\nyou are married.  Relate only what in your conscience\\nyou think necessary for me to hear.\"\\n\\n\"Marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that I was still\\nas dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,\\nmany weeks we had been separated, she was as constant\\nin her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy\\nof mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,\\nbecause time and London, business and dissipation,\\nhad in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing\\na fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,\\nand chusing to fancy that she too must have become\\nindifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment\\nas a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders\\nin proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\\novercoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,\\n\\'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.\\'--\\nBut this note made me know myself better.  I felt that\\nshe was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman\\nin the world, and that I was using her infamously.\\nBut every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey\\nand me.  To retreat was impossible.  All that I had to do,\\nwas to avoid you both.  I sent no answer to Marianne,\\nintending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;\\nand for some time I was even determined not to call in\\nBerkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect\\nthe air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,\\nI watched you all safely out of the house one morning,\\nand left my name.\"\\n\\n\"Watched us out of the house!\"\\n\\n\"Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often\\nI watched you, how often I was on the point of falling\\nin with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,\\nas the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did in Bond Street,\\nthere was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse\\nof one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\\nwatchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing\\ndesire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us\\nso long.  I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,\\nas well as everybody else who was likely to prove\\nan acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being\\nin town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,\\nthe first day of his coming, and the day after I had called\\nat Mrs. Jennings\\'s.  He asked me to a party, a dance at his\\nhouse in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement\\nthat you and your sister were to be there, I should have\\nfelt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.\\nThe next morning brought another short note from Marianne--\\nstill affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything\\nthat could make MY conduct most hateful.  I could not\\nanswer it.  I tried--but could not frame a sentence.\\nBut I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.\\nIf you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it\\nwas THEN.  With my head and heart full of your sister,\\nI was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those\\nthree or four weeks were worse than all.  Well, at last,\\nas I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a\\nsweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--\\nMarianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\\nWilloughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand\\nto me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching\\neyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and\\nSophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking\\nall that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over now.--\\nSuch an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;\\nbut not before I had seen Marianne\\'s sweet face as white\\nas death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--\\nthe last manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid\\nsight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying,\\nit was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew\\nexactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last\\nin this world.  She was before me, constantly before me,\\nas I travelled, in the same look and hue.\"\\n\\nA short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.\\nWilloughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:\\n\\n\"Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister\\nis certainly better, certainly out of danger?\"\\n\\n\"We are assured of it.\"\\n\\n\"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.\"\\n\\n\"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter;\\nhave you any thing to say about that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister\\nwrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.\\nYou saw what she said.  I was breakfasting at the\\nEllisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought\\nto me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch\\nSophia\\'s eye before it caught mine--and its size,\\nthe elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,\\nimmediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague report had\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady\\nin Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation\\nthe preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,\\nand made her more jealous than ever.  Affecting that air\\nof playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman\\none loves, she opened the letter directly, and read\\nits contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.\\nShe read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could\\nhave borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it\\nmust be appeased.  And, in short--what do you think of my\\nwife\\'s style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--\\ntruly feminine--was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying\\nsuch sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to.\\nThe original was all her own--her own happy thoughts\\nand gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we were engaged,\\nevery thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am\\ntalking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,\\nher money was necessary to me, and in a situation like\\nmine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.\\nAnd after all, what did it signify to my character\\nin the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language\\nmy answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.\\nMy business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether\\nI did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--\\n\\'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--\\' said I to\\nmyself--\\'I am shut out for ever from their society,\\nthey already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\\nwill only make them think me a blackguard one.\\' Such were\\nmy reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,\\nI copied my wife\\'s words, and parted with the last relics\\nof Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily they were all\\nin my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence,\\nand hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up,\\nand could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too\\nI had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,\\nwhich was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating\\nvirulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"\\n\\n\"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,\"\\nsaid Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself,\\nbetrayed her compassionate emotion; \"you ought not to speak\\nin this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister.\\nYou had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.\\nYour wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,\\nat least.  She must be attached to you, or she would not\\nhave married you.  To treat her with unkindness, to speak\\nof her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I\\nsuppose it a relief to your own conscience.\"\\n\\n\"Do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh.--\\n\"She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no\\nregard for her when we married.--Well, married we were,\\nand came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards\\nreturned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me,\\nMiss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--\\nAm I--be it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion\\nthan I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong.\\nHave I explained away any part of my guilt?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.--\\nYou have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than\\nI had believed you.  You have proved your heart less wicked,\\nmuch less wicked.  But I hardly know--the misery that\\nyou have inflicted--I hardly know what could have made\\nit worse.\"\\n\\n\"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered,\\nwhat I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened\\ntoo in her opinion as well as in yours.  You tell me that\\nshe has forgiven me already.  Let me be able to fancy that\\na better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings,\\nwill draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more\\ngentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery\\nand my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant\\nto her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer\\nto me than ever.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may\\ncomparatively be called, your justification.  But you have\\nnot explained to me the particular reason of your coming now,\\nnor how you heard of her illness.\"\\n\\n\"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir\\nJohn Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for the first\\ntime these two months--he spoke to me.--That he had cut\\nme ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise\\nor resentment.  Now, however, his good-natured, honest,\\nstupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern\\nfor your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling\\nme what he knew ought to--though probably he did not\\nthink it WOULD--vex me horridly.  As bluntly as he could\\nspeak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood\\nwas dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that\\nmorning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger\\nmost imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright,\\n&c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself\\noff as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John.\\nHis heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much\\nof his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,\\nhe almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an\\nold promise about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing\\nthat your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me\\nthe greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me\\nin her latest moments--for how could I tell what horrid\\nprojects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I\\nwas sure would represent me as capable of any thing--\\nWhat I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made,\\nand at eight o\\'clock this morning I was in my carriage.\\nNow you know all.\"\\n\\nElinor made no answer.  Her thoughts were silently fixed\\non the irreparable injury which too early an independence\\nand its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury,\\nhad made in the mind, the character, the happiness,\\nof a man who, to every advantage of person and talents,\\nunited a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\\nfeeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him\\nextravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him\\ncold-hearted and selfish.  Vanity, while seeking its own\\nguilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved\\nhim in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least\\nits offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.\\nEach faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led\\nhim likewise to punishment.  The attachment, from which\\nagainst honour, against feeling, against every better interest\\nhe had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,\\ngoverned every thought; and the connection, for the sake\\nof which he had, with little scruple, left her sister\\nto misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness\\nto himself of a far more incurable nature.  From a reverie\\nof this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes\\nby Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least\\nequally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--\\n\\n\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going back to town?\"\\n\\n\"No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there;\\nfrom thence to town in a day or two.  Good bye.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give\\nhim hers\\'s;--he pressed it with affection.\\n\\n\"And you DO think something better of me than\\nyou did?\"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against\\nthe mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.\\n\\nElinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave,\\npitied, wished him well--was even interested in his\\nhappiness--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour\\nmost likely to promote it.  His answer was not very encouraging.\\n\\n\"As to that,\" said he, \"I must rub through the world\\nas well as I can.  Domestic happiness is out of the question.\\nIf, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel\\nan interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it\\nmay put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to\\nlive for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.\\nWere I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\"\\n\\nElinor stopped him with a reproof.\\n\\n\"Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye. I shall\\nnow go away and live in dread of one event.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Your sister\\'s marriage.\"\\n\\n\"You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost\\nto you than she is now.\"\\n\\n\"But she will be gained by some one else.  And if\\nthat some one should be the very he whom, of all others,\\nI could least bear--but I will not stay to rob myself\\nof all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing\\nthat where I have most injured I can least forgive.\\nGood bye,--God bless you!\"\\n\\nAnd with these words, he almost ran out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 45\\n\\n\\nElinor, for some time after he left her, for some time\\neven after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained\\ntoo much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in\\nthemselves, but of which sadness was the general result,\\nto think even of her sister.\\n\\nWilloughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had\\nabhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite\\nof all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration\\nfor the sufferings produced by them, which made her\\nthink of him as now separated for ever from her family,\\nwith a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she\\nsoon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to\\nhis merits.  She felt that his influence over her mind\\nwas heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason\\nto have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\\nthat open, affectionate, and lively manner which it\\nwas no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love\\nfor Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.\\nBut she felt that it was so, long, long before she could\\nfeel his influence less.\\n\\nWhen at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne,\\nshe found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet\\na sleep to the extent of her hopes.  Elinor\\'s heart was full.\\nThe past, the present, the future, Willoughby\\'s visit,\\nMarianne\\'s safety, and her mother\\'s expected arrival,\\nthrew her altogether into an agitation of spirits\\nwhich kept off every indication of fatigue, and made\\nher only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.\\nShort was the time, however, in which that fear could\\naffect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby\\'s\\nleaving the house, she was again called down stairs\\nby the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her\\nmother from every unnecessary moment\\'s horrible suspense,\\nshe ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward\\ndoor just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the\\nhouse had produced almost the conviction of Marianne\\'s\\nbeing no more, had no voice to inquire after her,\\nno voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for\\nsalutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--\\nand her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,\\nwas in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she\\nhad been before by her fears.  She was supported into\\nthe drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--\\nand there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\\nto speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her\\nat intervals to press Colonel Brandon\\'s hand, with a look\\nwhich spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction\\nof his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.\\nHe shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.\\n\\nAs soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself,\\nto see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she\\nwas with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever\\nby absence, unhappiness, and danger.  Elinor\\'s delight,\\nas she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked\\nby an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;--\\nbut Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,\\nwhen the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne,\\nsatisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious\\nof being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the\\nsilence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.\\nMrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor,\\nin compliance with her mother\\'s entreaty, went to bed.\\nBut the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,\\nand many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to\\nmake requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.\\nWilloughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now allowed\\nherself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she\\nwould not but have heard his vindication for the world,\\nand now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him\\nso harshly before.  But her promise of relating it to her\\nsister was invariably painful.  She dreaded the performance\\nof it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be;\\ndoubted whether after such an explanation she could ever\\nbe happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby\\na widower.  Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,\\nfelt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more\\nthan to his rival\\'s, the reward of her sister was due,\\nand wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby\\'s death.\\n\\nThe shock of Colonel Brandon\\'s errand at Barton had been\\nmuch softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;\\nfor so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she\\nhad already determined to set out for Cleveland on that\\nvery day, without waiting for any further intelligence,\\nand had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\\nthat the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch\\nMargaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her\\nwhere there might be infection.\\n\\nMarianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant\\ncheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood\\'s looks and spirits proved\\nher to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of\\nthe happiest women in the world.  Elinor could not hear\\nthe declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes\\nwondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.\\nBut Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account\\nof her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,\\nwas led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only\\nof what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her\\nfrom a danger in which, as she now began to feel,\\nher own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\nattachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--\\nand in her recovery she had yet another source of joy\\nunthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her,\\nas soon as any opportunity of private conference\\nbetween them occurred.\\n\\n\"At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet\\nknow all my happiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.\\nHe has told me so himself.\"\\n\\nHer daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained,\\nsurprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.\\n\\n\"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should\\nwonder at your composure now.  Had I sat down to wish\\nfor any possible good to my family, I should have fixed\\non Colonel Brandon\\'s marrying one of you as the object\\nmost desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most\\nhappy with him of the two.\"\\n\\nElinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so,\\nbecause satisfied that none founded on an impartial\\nconsideration of their age, characters, or feelings,\\ncould be given;--but her mother must always be carried\\naway by her imagination on any interesting subject,\\nand therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n\"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.\\nIt came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may\\nwell believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could\\nnot conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,\\nand he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world\\nnow goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,\\nnot thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible\\nfeelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,\\naffection for Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since\\nthe first moment of seeing her.\"\\n\\nHere, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language,\\nnot the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural\\nembellishments of her mother\\'s active fancy, which fashioned\\nevery thing delightful to her as it chose.\\n\\n\"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything\\nthat Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,\\nas more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--\\nhas subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne\\'s\\nunhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and\\nwithout selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could\\nhe have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--\\nsuch openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived\\nin HIM.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Brandon\\'s character,\" said Elinor,\\n\"as an excellent man, is well established.\"\\n\\n\"I know it is\"--replied her mother seriously, \"or\\nafter such a warning, I should be the last to encourage\\nsuch affection, or even to be pleased by it.  But his coming\\nfor me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,\\nis enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"\\n\\n\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest\\non ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,\\nwere humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.\\nTo Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long\\nand intimately known; they equally love and respect him;\\nand even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,\\nis very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,\\nthat if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready\\nas yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing\\nto us in the world.  What answer did you give him?--Did you\\nallow him to hope?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him\\nor to myself.  Marianne might at that moment be dying.\\nBut he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  His was\\nan involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion\\nto a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.\\nYet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite\\novercome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,\\nmy greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;\\nand since our arrival, since our delightful security,\\nI have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\\nencouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time,\\nI tell him, will do everything;--Marianne\\'s heart is\\nnot to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--\\nHis own merits must soon secure it.\"\\n\\n\"To judge from the Colonel\\'s spirits, however,\\nyou have not yet made him equally sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"No.--He thinks Marianne\\'s affection too deeply\\nrooted for any change in it under a great length of time,\\nand even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident\\nof himself to believe, that with such a difference of age\\nand disposition he could ever attach her.  There, however,\\nhe is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond\\nhers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and\\nprinciples fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,\\nis exactly the very one to make your sister happy.\\nAnd his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.\\nMy partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not\\nso handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,\\nthere is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--\\nThere was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby\\'s\\neyes at times, which I did not like.\"\\n\\nElinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,\\nwithout waiting for her assent, continued,\\n\\n\"And his manners, the Colonel\\'s manners are not only\\nmore pleasing to me than Willoughby\\'s ever were, but they\\nare of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching\\nto Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine attention\\nto other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity\\nis much more accordant with her real disposition, than\\nthe liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed\\nof the other.  I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby\\nturned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself\\nthe contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy\\nwith HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.\"\\n\\nShe paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree\\nwith her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore\\ngave no offence.\\n\\n\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\"\\nadded Mrs. Dashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all\\nprobability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there\\ncertainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,\\nthat would suit us quite as well as our present situation.\"\\n\\nPoor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting\\nher to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.\\n\\n\"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know,\\neverybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know\\nnor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be\\na good one.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the entrance of a\\nthird person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over\\nin private, to wish success to her friend, and yet\\nin wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 46\\n\\n\\nMarianne\\'s illness, though weakening in its kind,\\nhad not been long enough to make her recovery slow;\\nand with youth, natural strength, and her mother\\'s presence\\nin aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,\\nwithin four days after the arrival of the latter,\\ninto Mrs. Palmer\\'s dressing-room.  When there, at her own\\nparticular request, for she was impatient to pour forth\\nher thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon\\nwas invited to visit her.\\n\\nHis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered\\nlooks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\\nheld out to him, was such, as, in Elinor\\'s conjecture,\\nmust arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,\\nor the consciousness of its being known to others;\\nand she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable\\nrecurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,\\nbrought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza\\nalready acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,\\nthe sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than\\nher daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,\\nand therefore watching to very different effect,\\nsaw nothing in the Colonel\\'s behaviour but what arose\\nfrom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in\\nthe actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself\\nto think that something more than gratitude already dawned.\\n\\nAt the end of another day or two, Marianne growing\\nvisibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,\\nurged equally by her own and her daughter\\'s wishes,\\nbegan to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER measures\\ndepended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could\\nnot quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods\\' stay; and Colonel\\nBrandon was soon brought, by their united request,\\nto consider his own abode there as equally determinate,\\nif not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs. Jennings\\'s\\nunited request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed\\non to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,\\nfor the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,\\nat the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,\\nwhose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable\\nfor other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure\\nto redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course\\nof a few weeks.\\n\\nThe day of separation and departure arrived;\\nand Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened\\na leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full\\nof respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart\\nfrom a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\\nColonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,\\nwas carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he\\nseemed anxious that she should engross at least half.\\nMrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others\\nwere left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,\\nand feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned\\nto her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\\nfor the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\\nimmediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne\\nbore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.\\nEvery thing that the most zealous affection, the most\\nsolicitous care could do to render her comfortable,\\nwas the office of each watchful companion, and each\\nfound their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness\\nof spirits.  To Elinor, the observation of the latter\\nwas particularly grateful.  She, who had seen her week\\nafter week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish\\nof heart which she had neither courage to speak of,\\nnor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other\\ncould equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,\\nin being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,\\nmust eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.\\n\\nAs they approached Barton, indeed, and entered\\non scenes of which every field and every tree brought\\nsome peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent\\nand thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,\\nsat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,\\nElinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,\\nas she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she\\nhad been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural\\nin itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,\\nand in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the\\nwhole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction\\nof a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner\\nhad they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne\\nturned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,\\nas if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\\nof every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\\nbe connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed\\nat cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,\\nit never passed away without the atonement of a smile.\\nAfter dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;\\nbut the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,\\nprocured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\\nfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\nin his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,\\nput the music aside, and after running over the keys\\nfor a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,\\nand closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness\\nas she did so, that she should in future practice much.\\n\\nThe next morning produced no abatement in these\\nhappy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a mind and body\\nalike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with\\nmore genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\\nMargaret\\'s return, and talking of the dear family party\\nwhich would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits\\nand cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.\\n\\n\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered\\nmy strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together\\nevery day.  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,\\nand see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John\\'s\\nnew plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\\nand we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,\\nand try to trace its foundations as far as we are told\\nthey once reached.  I know we shall be happy.  I know\\nthe summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to be\\nlater in rising than six, and from that time till dinner\\nI shall divide every moment between music and reading.\\nI have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course\\nof serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,\\nto be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.\\nBut there are many works well worth reading at the Park;\\nand there are others of more modern production which I\\nknow I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six\\nhours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month\\na great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.\"\\n\\nElinor honoured her for a plan which originated\\nso nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager\\nfancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid\\nindolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing\\nexcess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous\\nself-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,\\nand feared she had that to communicate which might again\\nunsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time\\nthis fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  Willing therefore\\nto delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her\\nsister\\'s health were more secure, before she appointed it.\\nBut the resolution was made only to be broken.\\n\\nMarianne had been two or three days at home, before\\nthe weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself\\nto venture out.  But at last a soft, genial morning appeared;\\nsuch as might tempt the daughter\\'s wishes and the\\nmother\\'s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor\\'s arm,\\nwas authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,\\nin the lane before the house.\\n\\nThe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness\\nof Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\\nillness required;--and they had advanced only so far\\nbeyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,\\nthe important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes\\nturned towards it, Marianne calmly said,\\n\\n\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand,\\n\"on that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there\\nI first saw Willoughby.\"\\n\\nHer voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\\n\\n\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain\\non the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\"--\\nhesitatingly it was said.--\"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk\\nof it now, I hope, as I ought to do.\"--\\n\\nElinor tenderly invited her to be open.\\n\\n\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that,\\nas far as HE is concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you\\nof what my feelings have been for him, but what they\\nare NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,\\nif I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS\\nacting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,\\nif I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked\\nas my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story\\nof that unfortunate girl\"--\\n\\nShe stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words\\nas she answered,\\n\\n\"If you could be assured of that, you think you\\nshould be easy.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--\\nfor not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has\\nbeen what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must\\nit make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,\\nbut a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose\\nme to\"--\\n\\n\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account\\nfor his behaviour?\"\\n\\n\"I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him,\\nonly fickle, very, very fickle.\"\\n\\nElinor said no more.  She was debating within herself\\non the eligibility of beginning her story directly,\\nor postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--\\nand they crept on for a few minutes in silence.\\n\\n\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne\\nat last with a sigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections\\nmay be no more unpleasant than my own.  He will suffer\\nenough in them.\"\\n\\n\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\\n\\n\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been;\\nI compare it with yours.\"\\n\\n\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\\n\\n\"They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not,\\nmy dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know\\nyour judgment must censure.  My illness has made me think--\\nIt has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.\\nLong before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly\\nable to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my\\nown behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance\\nwith him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence\\ntowards myself, and want of kindness to others.\\nI saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,\\nand that my want of fortitude under them had almost led\\nme to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been\\nentirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my\\nown health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\\nHad I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I\\ndid not know my danger till the danger was removed;\\nbut with such feelings as these reflections gave me,\\nI wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness\\nof my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\\nand to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I died,--\\nin what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,\\nmy friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful\\nselfishness of my latter days; who had known all the\\nmurmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR\\nremembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled\\nher!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.\\nWhenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,\\nor some failing indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.\\nThe kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\\nI had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletons,\\nto the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,\\nI had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened\\nagainst their merits, and a temper irritated by their\\nvery attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,\\nlittle as they deserve, I had given less than their due.\\nBut you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged\\nby me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;\\nyet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion\\nthat could benefit you or myself.--Your example was\\nbefore me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate\\nof you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,\\nor lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those\\noffices of general complaisance or particular gratitude\\nwhich you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--\\nnot less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I\\nhad believed you at ease, did I turn away from every\\nexertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow\\nto exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart\\nwhich had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,\\nfor or I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable\\nfor my sake.\"\\n\\nHere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;\\nand Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest\\nto flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support\\nwhich her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.\\nMarianne pressed her hand and replied,\\n\\n\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof.\\nI have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering\\nto it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.\\nThey shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.\\nI shall now live solely for my family.  You, my mother,\\nand Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me;\\nyou will share my affections entirely between you.\\n>From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest\\nincitement to move; and if I do mix in other society,\\nit will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,\\nmy heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities,\\nthe lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.\\nAs for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall\\never forget him, would be idle.  His remembrance can be overcome\\nby no change of circumstances or opinions.  But it shall\\nbe regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,\\nby constant employment.\"\\n\\nShe paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could\\nbut know HIS heart, everything would become easy.\"\\n\\nElinor, who had now been for some time reflecting\\non the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding\\nher narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than\\nat first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection\\ndid nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\\nleading to the fact.\\n\\nShe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address;\\nprepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply\\nand honestly the chief points on which Willoughby\\ngrounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,\\nand softened only his protestations of present regard.\\nMarianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes\\nwere fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter\\nthan even sickness had left them.  A thousand inquiries\\nsprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.\\nShe caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister\\'s, and\\ntears covered her cheeks.\\n\\nElinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home;\\nand till they reached the door of the cottage,\\neasily conjecturing what her curiosity must be\\nthough no question was suffered to speak it, talked of\\nnothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together;\\nand was carefully minute in every particular of speech\\nand look, where minuteness could be safely indulged.\\nAs soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss\\nof gratitude and these two words just articulate through\\nher tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and\\nwalked slowly up stairs.  Elinor would not attempt\\nto disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;\\nand with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,\\nand a resolution of reviving the subject again,\\nshould Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour\\nto fulfill her parting injunction.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 47\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication\\nof her former favourite.  She rejoiced in his being\\ncleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was\\nsorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the feelings\\nof the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore\\nhim with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished,\\nto Marianne.  Nothing could do away the knowledge\\nof what the latter had suffered through his means,\\nnor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.\\nNothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,\\nnor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.\\n\\nHad Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby\\'s\\nstory from himself--had she witnessed his distress,\\nand been under the influence of his countenance and his\\nmanner, it is probable that her compassion would have\\nbeen greater.  But it was neither in Elinor\\'s power,\\nnor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her\\nretailed explanation, as had at first been called forth\\nin herself.  Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,\\nand sobered her own opinion of Willoughby\\'s deserts;--\\nshe wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,\\nand lay open such facts as were really due to his character,\\nwithout any embellishment of tenderness to lead the\\nfancy astray.\\n\\nIn the evening, when they were all three together,\\nMarianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--\\nbut that it was not without an effort, the restless,\\nunquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time\\npreviously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--\\nand her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.\\n\\n\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see\\nevery thing--as you can desire me to do.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly\\nwith soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished\\nto hear her sister\\'s unbiased opinion, by an eager sign,\\nengaged her silence.  Marianne slowly continued--\\n\\n\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told\\nme this morning--I have now heard exactly what I\\nwished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice was lost;\\nbut recovering herself, she added, and with greater\\ncalmness than before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied,\\nI wish for no change.  I never could have been happy\\nwith him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must\\nhave known, all this.--I should have had no confidence,\\nno esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother.\\n\"Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one\\nwho so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,\\nand the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart\\nto be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her\\nsensitive conscience, would have felt all that the\\nconscience of her husband ought to have felt.\"\\n\\nMarianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"\\n\\n\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as\\na good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;\\nand I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only\\nin this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough\\nto be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\\nin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which\\nyou would have been poorly supported by an affection,\\non his side, much less certain.  Had you married,\\nyou must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is\\nacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares\\nthat self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.\\nHis demands and your inexperience together, on a small,\\nvery small income, must have brought on distresses which\\nwould not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been\\nentirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense\\nof honour and honesty would have led you, I know,\\nwhen aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy\\nthat would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long\\nas your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,\\nyou might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--\\nand how little could the utmost of your single management\\ndo to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--\\nBeyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,\\nto abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead\\nof prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,\\nyou would have lessened your own influence on his heart,\\nand made him regret the connection which had involved him\\nin such difficulties?\"\\n\\nMarianne\\'s lips quivered, and she repeated the word\\n\"Selfish?\" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think\\nhim selfish?\"\\n\\n\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor,\\n\"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been\\ngrounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness which first\\nmade him sport with your affections; which afterwards,\\nwhen his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\\nof it, and which finally carried him from Barton.\\nHis own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,\\nhis ruling principle.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\"\\n\\n\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he\\nhas done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds\\nit has not answered towards himself.  It has not made\\nhim happy.  His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he\\nsuffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\\nthan yourself.  But does it follow that had he married you,\\nhe would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have\\nbeen different.  He would then have suffered under the\\npecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,\\nhe now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife\\nof whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would\\nhave been always necessitous--always poor; and probably\\nwould soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts\\nof a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,\\neven to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I\\nhave nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly.\"\\n\\n\"Rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Dashwood; \"SHE must be answerable.\"\\n\\nMarianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,\\nsatisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid\\nany survey of the past that might weaken her sister\\'s\\nspirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,\\nimmediately continued,\\n\\n\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from\\nthe whole of the story--that all Willoughby\\'s difficulties\\nhave arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his\\nbehaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime has been the origin\\nof every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"\\n\\nMarianne assented most feelingly to the remark;\\nand her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel\\nBrandon\\'s injuries and merits, warm as friendship\\nand design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did\\nnot look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\\n\\nElinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two\\nor three following days, that Marianne did not continue\\nto gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution\\nwas unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful\\nand easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect\\nof time upon her health.\\n\\nMargaret returned, and the family were again all\\nrestored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;\\nand if not pursuing their usual studies with quite\\nso much vigour as when they first came to Barton,\\nat least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\\n\\nElinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.\\nShe had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,\\nnothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his\\npresent abode.  Some letters had passed between her\\nand her brother, in consequence of Marianne\\'s illness;\\nand in the first of John\\'s, there had been this sentence:--\\n\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no\\nenquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him\\nto be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence\\nof Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name\\nwas not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\\nShe was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of\\nhis measures.\\n\\nTheir man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter\\non business; and when, as he waited at table, he had\\nsatisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event\\nof his errand, this was his voluntary communication--\\n\\n\"I suppose you know, ma\\'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\\n\\nMarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes\\nupon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her\\nchair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she\\nanswered the servant\\'s inquiry, had intuitively taken\\nthe same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor\\'s\\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment\\nafterwards, alike distressed by Marianne\\'s situation,\\nknew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.\\n\\nThe servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was\\ntaken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,\\nwho, with Mrs. Dashwood\\'s assistance, supported her into\\nthe other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather better,\\nand her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret\\nand the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still\\nmuch disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason\\nand voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,\\nas to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood\\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion\\nof seeking it.\\n\\n\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"\\n\\n\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning\\nin Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was.  They was\\nstopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn,\\nas I went there with a message from Sally at the Park\\nto her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened\\nto look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly\\nit was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat,\\nand she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,\\nma\\'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne,\\nand bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars\\'s,\\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they\\nwas they had not time to come on and see you, but they was\\nin a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further\\ndown for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,\\nthey\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"\\n\\n\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. She smiled, and said how she\\nhad changed her name since she was in these parts.\\nShe was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,\\nand very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\"\\n\\n\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, I just see him leaning back in it,\\nbut he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much\\nfor talking.\"\\n\\nElinor\\'s heart could easily account for his not\\nputting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably\\nfound the same explanation.\\n\\n\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, only they two.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know where they came from?\"\\n\\n\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--\\nMrs. Ferrars told me.\"\\n\\n\"And are they going farther westward?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon\\nbe back again, and then they\\'d be sure and call here.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;\\nbut Elinor knew better than to expect them.\\nShe recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was\\nvery confident that Edward would never come near them.\\nShe observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they\\nwere probably going down to Mr. Pratt\\'s, near Plymouth.\\n\\nThomas\\'s intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked\\nas if she wished to hear more.\\n\\n\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but I\\ncould not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well;\\nand to my mind she was always a very handsome young\\nlady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood could think of no other question,\\nand Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,\\nwere soon afterwards dismissed.  Marianne had already sent\\nto say, that she should eat nothing more.  Mrs. Dashwood\\'s\\nand Elinor\\'s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much\\nuneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,\\nso much reason as they had often had to be careless\\nof their meals, she had never been obliged to go without\\nher dinner before.\\n\\nWhen the dessert and the wine were arranged,\\nand Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves,\\nthey remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness\\nand silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark,\\nand ventured not to offer consolation.  She now found\\nthat she had erred in relying on Elinor\\'s representation\\nof herself; and justly concluded that every thing\\nhad been expressly softened at the time, to spare her\\nfrom an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then\\nhad suffered for Marianne.  She found that she had been\\nmisled by the careful, the considerate attention of\\nher daughter, to think the attachment, which once she\\nhad so well understood, much slighter in reality, than\\nshe had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved\\nto be.  She feared that under this persuasion she had\\nbeen unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--\\nthat Marianne\\'s affliction, because more acknowledged,\\nmore immediately before her, had too much engrossed\\nher tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor\\nshe might have a daughter suffering almost as much,\\ncertainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 48\\n\\n\\nElinor now found the difference between the expectation\\nof an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told\\nto consider it, and certainty itself.  She now found, that\\nin spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,\\nwhile Edward remained single, that something would occur\\nto prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of\\nhis own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible\\nopportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise\\nto assist the happiness of all.  But he was now married;\\nand she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,\\nwhich so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.\\n\\nThat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined)\\nhe could be in orders, and consequently before he could\\nbe in possession of the living, surprised her a little\\nat first.  But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,\\nin her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,\\nshould overlook every thing but the risk of delay.\\nThey were married, married in town, and now hastening\\ndown to her uncle\\'s.  What had Edward felt on being within\\nfour miles from Barton, on seeing her mother\\'s servant,\\non hearing Lucy\\'s message!\\n\\nThey would soon, she supposed, be settled at\\nDelaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much\\nconspired to give her an interest; which she wished\\nto be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.\\nShe saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw\\nin Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once\\na desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,\\nand ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--\\npursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the\\nfavour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every\\nwealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw,\\nnor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing\\npleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.\\n\\nElinor flattered herself that some one of their\\nconnections in London would write to them to announce\\nthe event, and give farther particulars,--but day after\\nday passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.\\nThough uncertain that any one were to blame, she found\\nfault with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless\\nor indolent.\\n\\n\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma\\'am?\"\\nwas an inquiry which sprung from the impatience\\nof her mind to have something going on.\\n\\n\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather\\nexpect to see, than to hear from him again.  I earnestly\\npressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised\\nto see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\\n\\nThis was gaining something, something to look forward to.\\nColonel Brandon must have some information to give.\\n\\nScarcely had she so determined it, when the figure\\nof a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.\\nHe stopt at their gate.  It was a gentleman, it\\nwas Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;\\nand she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was\\nNOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height.\\nWere it possible, she must say it must be Edward.\\nShe looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she could not be\\nmistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.\\n\"He comes from Mr. Pratt\\'s purposely to see us.  I WILL be\\ncalm; I WILL be mistress of myself.\"\\n\\nIn a moment she perceived that the others were likewise\\naware of the mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne\\nchange colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper\\na few sentences to each other.  She would have given\\nthe world to be able to speak--and to make them understand\\nthat she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear\\nin their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,\\nand was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.\\n\\nNot a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited\\nin silence for the appearance of their visitor.\\nHis footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment\\nhe was in the passage, and in another he was before them.\\n\\nHis countenance, as he entered the room, was not\\ntoo happy, even for Elinor.  His complexion was white\\nwith agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his\\nreception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\\nMrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,\\nto the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant\\nin the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,\\nmet with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,\\nand wished him joy.\\n\\nHe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.\\nElinor\\'s lips had moved with her mother\\'s, and, when the\\nmoment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken\\nhands with him too.  But it was then too late, and with a\\ncountenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\\nand talked of the weather.\\n\\nMarianne had retreated as much as possible\\nout of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret,\\nunderstanding some part, but not the whole of the case,\\nthought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore\\ntook a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained\\na strict silence.\\n\\nWhen Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness\\nof the season, a very awful pause took place.  It was put\\nan end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he\\nhad left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a hurried manner,\\nhe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\nAnother pause.\\n\\nElinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing\\nthe sound of her own voice, now said,\\n\\n\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"\\n\\n\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise.--\\n\"No, my mother is in town.\"\\n\\n\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from\\nthe table, \"to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.\"\\n\\nShe dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both\\nturned their eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed,\\nlooked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs.\\nROBERT Ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her\\nmother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though\\nElinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him\\nwith the same impatient wonder.  He rose from his seat,\\nand walked to the window, apparently from not knowing\\nwhat to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,\\nand while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting\\nthe latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,\\n\\n\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard\\nthat my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to\\nMiss Lucy Steele.\"\\n\\nHis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment\\nby all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over\\nher work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly\\nknow where she was.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week,\\nand are now at Dawlish.\"\\n\\nElinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran\\nout of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,\\nburst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would\\nnever cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any where,\\nrather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--\\nor even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards\\nhe fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,\\nno affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,\\nand at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,\\nand walked out towards the village--leaving the others\\nin the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change\\nin his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity\\nwhich they had no means of lessening but by their\\nown conjectures.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 49\\n\\n\\nUnaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his\\nrelease might appear to the whole family, it was certain\\nthat Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would\\nbe employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after\\nexperiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement,\\ncontracted without his mother\\'s consent, as he had already\\ndone for more than four years, nothing less could be expected\\nof him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction\\nof another.\\n\\nHis errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.\\nIt was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering\\nthat he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,\\nit might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable\\nin the present case as he really did, so much in need of\\nencouragement and fresh air.\\n\\nHow soon he had walked himself into the proper\\nresolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising\\nit occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,\\nand how he was received, need not be particularly told.\\nThis only need be said;--that when they all sat down to\\ntable at four o\\'clock, about three hours after his arrival,\\nhe had secured his lady, engaged her mother\\'s consent,\\nand was not only in the rapturous profession of\\nthe lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,\\none of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was\\nmore than commonly joyful.  He had more than the ordinary\\ntriumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise\\nhis spirits.  He was released without any reproach\\nto himself, from an entanglement which had long formed\\nhis misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--\\nand elevated at once to that security with another,\\nwhich he must have thought of almost with despair,\\nas soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.\\nHe was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from\\nmisery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken\\nin such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,\\nas his friends had never witnessed in him before.\\n\\nHis heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,\\nall its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment\\nto Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.\\n\\n\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\"\\nsaid he, \"the consequence of ignorance of the world--\\nand want of employment.  Had my brother given me\\nsome active profession when I was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure,\\nit would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple\\nwith what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable\\npreference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit,\\nany object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\\nfrom her for a few months, I should very soon have\\noutgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing\\nmore with the world, as in such case I must have done.\\nBut instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any\\nprofession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself,\\nI returned home to be completely idle; and for the first\\ntwelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me;\\nfor I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen.\\nI had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy\\nmyself in love; and as my mother did not make my home\\nin every respect comfortable, as I had no friend,\\nno companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance,\\nit was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,\\nwhere I always felt myself at home, and was always sure\\nof a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part\\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared\\neverything that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty\\ntoo--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little\\nof other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see\\nno defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I hope,\\nfoolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since\\nin every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural\\nor an inexcusable piece of folly.\"\\n\\nThe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds\\nand the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as\\npromised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.\\nMrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how\\nto love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough\\nthankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,\\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\nconversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,\\nthe sight and society of both.\\n\\nMarianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.\\nComparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,\\nthough sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to\\ngive her neither spirits nor language.\\n\\nBut Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From\\nthe moment of learning that Lucy was married to another,\\nthat Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying\\nthe hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every\\nthing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment\\nhad passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\\nremoved, compared her situation with what so lately it\\nhad been,--saw him honourably released from his former\\nengagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release,\\nto address herself and declare an affection as tender,\\nas constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she\\nwas oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;--\\nand happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily\\nfamiliarized with any change for the better, it required\\nseveral hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any\\ndegree of tranquillity to her heart.\\n\\nEdward was now fixed at the cottage at least for\\na week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him,\\nit was impossible that less than a week should be given\\nup to the enjoyment of Elinor\\'s company, or suffice\\nto say half that was to be said of the past, the present,\\nand the future;--for though a very few hours spent in\\nthe hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more\\nsubjects than can really be in common between any two\\nrational creatures, yet with lovers it is different.\\nBetween THEM no subject is finished, no communication\\nis even made, till it has been made at least twenty\\ntimes over.\\n\\nLucy\\'s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder\\namong them all, formed of course one of the earliest\\ndiscussions of the lovers;--and Elinor\\'s particular knowledge\\nof each party made it appear to her in every view, as one\\nof the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances\\nshe had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,\\nand by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry\\na girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak\\nwithout any admiration,--a girl too already engaged\\nto his brother, and on whose account that brother had been\\nthrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension\\nto make out.  To her own heart it was a delightful affair,\\nto her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but\\nto her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\\n\\nEdward could only attempt an explanation by supposing,\\nthat, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity\\nof the one had been so worked on by the flattery\\nof the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.\\nElinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother\\'s\\naffairs might have done, if applied to in time.\\nShe repeated it to Edward.\\n\\n\"THAT was exactly like Robert,\"--was his immediate\\nobservation.--\"And THAT,\" he presently added, \"might\\nperhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between\\nthem first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour.\\nOther designs might afterward arise.\"\\n\\nHow long it had been carrying on between them,\\nhowever, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out;\\nfor at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since\\nhis quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her\\nbut from herself, and her letters to the very last were\\nneither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.\\nNot the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred\\nto prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it\\nburst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been\\nfor some time, he believed, half stupified between\\nthe wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.\\nHe put the letter into Elinor\\'s hands.\\n\\n     \"DEAR SIR,\\n\\n     \"Being very sure I have long lost your affections,\\n     I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own\\n     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with\\n     him as I once used to think I might be with you;\\n     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was\\n     another\\'s.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,\\n     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always\\n     good friends, as our near relationship now makes\\n     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,\\n     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any\\n     ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections\\n     entirely, and as we could not live without one\\n     another, we are just returned from the altar, and\\n     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which\\n     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\\n     but thought I would first trouble you with these\\n     few lines, and shall always remain,\\n\\n     \"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\\n                                        \"LUCY FERRARS.\\n\\n     \"I have burnt all your letters, and will return\\n     your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy\\n     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very\\n     welcome to keep.\"\\n\\nElinor read and returned it without any comment.\\n\\n\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\"\\nsaid Edward.--\"For worlds would not I have had a letter\\nof hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it\\nis bad enough, but in a wife!--how I have blushed over\\nthe pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that\\nsince the first half year of our foolish--business--this\\nis the only letter I ever received from her, of which\\nthe substance made me any amends for the defect of the style.\"\\n\\n\"However it may have come about,\" said Elinor,\\nafter a pause,--\"they are certainly married.  And your mother\\nhas brought on herself a most appropriate punishment.\\nThe independence she settled on Robert, through resentment\\nagainst you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;\\nand she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\\na-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the\\nother for intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt,\\nI suppose, by Robert\\'s marrying Lucy, than she would have\\nbeen by your marrying her.\"\\n\\n\"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always\\nwas her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it,\\nand on the same principle will forgive him much sooner.\"\\n\\nIn what state the affair stood at present between them,\\nEdward knew not, for no communication with any of his family\\nhad yet been attempted by him.  He had quitted Oxford\\nwithin four and twenty hours after Lucy\\'s letter arrived,\\nand with only one object before him, the nearest road\\nto Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct,\\nwith which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.\\nHe could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\nMiss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate,\\nit is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with\\nwhich he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite\\nof the modesty with which he rated his own deserts,\\nand the politeness with which he talked of his doubts,\\nhe did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception.\\nIt was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he\\nsaid it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject\\na twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination\\nof husbands and wives.\\n\\nThat Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off\\nwith a flourish of malice against him in her message\\nby Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself,\\nnow thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no\\nscruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness\\nof wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\\neven before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her\\nignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--\\nthey had been equally imputed, by him, to her want\\nof education; and till her last letter reached him,\\nhe had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.\\nNothing but such a persuasion could have prevented\\nhis putting an end to an engagement, which, long before\\nthe discovery of it laid him open to his mother\\'s anger,\\nhad been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.\\n\\n\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings,\\nto give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,\\nwhen I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all\\nappearance without a friend in the world to assist me.\\nIn such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing\\nto tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,\\nhow could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted\\non sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing\\nbut the most disinterested affection was her inducement?\\nAnd even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,\\nor what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be\\nfettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,\\nand who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\\nShe could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a\\nliving.\"\\n\\n\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur\\nin your favour; that your own family might in time relent.\\nAnd at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,\\nfor she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination\\nnor her actions.  The connection was certainly a\\nrespectable one, and probably gained her consideration among\\nher friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,\\nit would be better for her to marry YOU than be single.\"\\n\\nEdward was, of course, immediately convinced that\\nnothing could have been more natural than Lucy\\'s conduct,\\nnor more self-evident than the motive of it.\\n\\nElinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold\\nthe imprudence which compliments themselves, for having\\nspent so much time with them at Norland, when he must\\nhave felt his own inconstancy.\\n\\n\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she;\\n\"because--to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations\\nwere all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you\\nwere THEN situated, could never be.\"\\n\\nHe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart,\\nand a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.\\n\\n\"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH\\nwas plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being\\nwith you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was\\nto keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.  I felt\\nthat I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;\\nand till I began to make comparisons between yourself\\nand Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that,\\nI suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,\\nand the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the\\nexpediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger\\nis my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself.\"\\n\\nElinor smiled, and shook her head.\\n\\nEdward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon\\'s\\nbeing expected at the Cottage, as he really wished\\nnot only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an\\nopportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\\nhis giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"\\nsaid he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine\\nwere on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven\\nhim for offering.\"\\n\\nNOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet\\nbeen to the place.  But so little interest had be taken\\nin the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,\\ngarden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of\\nthe land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,\\nwho had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon,\\nand heard it with so much attention, as to be entirely\\nmistress of the subject.\\n\\nOne question after this only remained undecided,\\nbetween them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.\\nThey were brought together by mutual affection,\\nwith the warmest approbation of their real friends;\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make\\ntheir happiness certain--and they only wanted something\\nto live upon.  Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor\\none, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could\\ncall their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood\\nshould advance anything; and they were neither of them\\nquite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\\npounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.\\n\\nEdward was not entirely without hopes of some\\nfavourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT\\nhe rested for the residue of their income.  But Elinor\\nhad no such dependence; for since Edward would still\\nbe unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself\\nhad been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars\\'s flattering language\\nas only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,\\nshe feared that Robert\\'s offence would serve no other\\npurpose than to enrich Fanny.\\n\\nAbout four days after Edward\\'s arrival Colonel\\nBrandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood\\'s satisfaction,\\nand to give her the dignity of having, for the first time\\nsince her living at Barton, more company with her than\\nher house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore\\nwalked every night to his old quarters at the Park;\\nfrom whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough\\nto interrupt the lovers\\' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.\\n\\nA three weeks\\' residence at Delaford, where,\\nin his evening hours at least, he had little to do\\nbut to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six\\nand seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne\\'s looks,\\nall the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement\\nof her mother\\'s language, to make it cheerful.\\nAmong such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.\\nNo rumour of Lucy\\'s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his\\nvisit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.\\nEvery thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,\\nand he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done\\nfor Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest\\nof Elinor.\\n\\nIt would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced\\nin the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each\\nother\\'s acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise.\\nTheir resemblance in good principles and good sense,\\nin disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship,\\nwithout any other attraction; but their being in love\\nwith two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,\\nmade that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time\\nand judgment.\\n\\nThe letters from town, which a few days before would\\nhave made every nerve in Elinor\\'s body thrill with transport,\\nnow arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.\\nMrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her\\nhonest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth\\nher compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,\\nhad quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,\\nby all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--\\n\"I do think,\" she continued, \"nothing was ever carried\\non so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called\\nand sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul suspected\\nanything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!\\ncame crying to me the day after, in a great fright\\nfor fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to\\nget to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\\nmoney before she went off to be married, on purpose\\nwe suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not\\nseven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give\\nher five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she\\nthinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,\\nin hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.\\nAnd I must say that Lucy\\'s crossness not to take them\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all.\\nPoor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you\\nmust send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to\\ncomfort him.\"\\n\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s strains were more solemn.\\nMrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor\\nFanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he\\nconsidered the existence of each, under such a blow,\\nwith grateful wonder.  Robert\\'s offence was unpardonable,\\nbut Lucy\\'s was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were\\never again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,\\nif she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,\\nhis wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,\\nnor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy\\nwith which everything had been carried on between them,\\nwas rationally treated as enormously heightening\\nthe crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred\\nto the others, proper measures would have been taken\\nto prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\\nwith him in regretting that Lucy\\'s engagement with Edward\\nhad not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus\\nbe the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--\\nHe thus continued:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward\\'s name,\\nwhich does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment,\\nnot a line has been received from him on the occasion.\\nPerhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,\\nand I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line\\nto Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter\\nof proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,\\nand by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;\\nfor we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars\\'s heart,\\nand that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms\\nwith her children.\"\\n\\nThis paragraph was of some importance to the\\nprospects and conduct of Edward.  It determined him\\nto attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly\\nin the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\\n\\n\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he;\\n\"would they have me beg my mother\\'s pardon for Robert\\'s\\ningratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can\\nmake no submission--I am grown neither humble nor\\npenitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy;\\nbut that would not interest.--I know of no submission\\nthat IS proper for me to make.\"\\n\\n\"You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said Elinor,\\n\"because you have offended;--and I should think you\\nmight NOW venture so far as to profess some concern\\nfor having ever formed the engagement which drew on you\\nyour mother\\'s anger.\"\\n\\nHe agreed that he might.\\n\\n\"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility\\nmay be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement,\\nalmost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first.\"\\n\\nHe had nothing to urge against it, but still\\nresisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;\\nand therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared\\na much greater willingness to make mean concessions\\nby word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,\\ninstead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London,\\nand personally intreat her good offices in his favour.--\\n\"And if they really DO interest themselves,\" said Marianne,\\nin her new character of candour, \"in bringing about\\na reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny\\nare not entirely without merit.\"\\n\\nAfter a visit on Colonel Brandon\\'s side of only three\\nor four days, the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.--\\nThey were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward\\nmight have some personal knowledge of his future home,\\nand assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\nimprovements were needed to it; and from thence,\\nafter staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed\\non his journey to town.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 50\\n\\n\\nAfter a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars,\\njust so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that\\nreproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,\\nthe reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted\\nto her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\\n\\nHer family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.\\nFor many years of her life she had had two sons;\\nbut the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago,\\nhad robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert\\nhad left her for a fortnight without any; and now,\\nby the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\\n\\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live,\\nhowever, he did not feel the continuance of his existence\\nsecure, till he had revealed his present engagement;\\nfor the publication of that circumstance, he feared,\\nmight give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry\\nhim off as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution\\ntherefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with\\nunexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably\\nendeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,\\nby every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton\\nhe would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--\\nand enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton\\nwas the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,\\nwhile Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private\\ngentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,\\nthough perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\\nhe was by no means inclined to be guided by it,\\nshe judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,\\nto submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay\\nas she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent\\nevery suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree\\nof consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\\n\\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting\\ntheir income was next to be considered; and here it\\nplainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,\\nhe was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,\\nnot the smallest objection was made against Edward\\'s taking\\norders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;\\nnor was anything promised either for the present or in future,\\nbeyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.\\n\\nIt was as much, however, as was desired,\\nand more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor;\\nand Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\\n\\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants\\nthus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for\\nafter Edward was in possession of the living, but the\\nreadiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,\\nwith an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,\\nwas making considerable improvements; and after waiting\\nsome time for their completion, after experiencing,\\nas usual, a thousand disappointments and delays\\nfrom the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution\\nof not marrying till every thing was ready, and the\\nceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.\\n\\nThe first month after their marriage was spent\\nwith their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence\\nthey could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,\\nand direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--\\ncould chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\\nMrs. Jennings\\'s prophecies, though rather jumbled together,\\nwere chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward\\nand his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she\\nfound in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,\\none of the happiest couples in the world.  They had\\nin fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel\\nBrandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for\\ntheir cows.\\n\\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost\\nall their relations and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came\\nto inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\\nof having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at\\nthe expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\\n\\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\"\\nsaid John, as they were walking together one morning before\\nthe gates of Delaford House, \"THAT would be saying too much,\\nfor certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\\nwomen in the world, as it is.  But, I confess, it would\\ngive me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.\\nHis property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I\\nhave not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there\\nis now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,\\nMarianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--\\nyet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to\\nhave them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what\\nmay happen--for, when people are much thrown together,\\nand see little of anybody else--and it will always be\\nin your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--\\nin short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand\\nme.\"--\\n\\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always\\ntreated them with the make-believe of decent affection,\\nthey were never insulted by her real favour and preference.\\nTHAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning\\nof his wife; and it was earned by them before many months\\nhad passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter,\\nwhich had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,\\nwas the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;\\nfor her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,\\nand endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening\\nwas given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\\nto his choice, and re-established him completely in\\nher favour.\\n\\nThe whole of Lucy\\'s behaviour in the affair,\\nand the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held\\nforth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,\\nan unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress\\nmay be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\\nand conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,\\nand privately visited her in Bartlett\\'s Buildings,\\nit was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.\\nHe merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;\\nand as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews\\nwould settle the matter.  In that point, however,\\nand that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him\\nhopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,\\nanother visit, another conversation, was always wanted\\nto produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered\\nin her mind when they parted, which could only be\\nremoved by another half hour\\'s discourse with himself.\\nHis attendance was by this means secured, and the rest\\nfollowed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward,\\nthey came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject\\non which he had always more to say than on any other,\\nand in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\\nto his own; and in short, it became speedily evident\\nto both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.\\nHe was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward,\\nand very proud of marrying privately without his\\nmother\\'s consent.  What immediately followed is known.\\nThey passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish;\\nfor she had many relations and old acquaintances to\\ncut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--\\nand from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness\\nof Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,\\nwhich, at Lucy\\'s instigation, was adopted.  The forgiveness,\\nat first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert;\\nand Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore\\ncould have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\\nlonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct\\nand messages, in self-condemnation for Robert\\'s offence,\\nand gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,\\nprocured her in time the haughty notice which overcame\\nher by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid\\ndegrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\\nLucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert\\nor Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven\\nfor having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,\\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken\\nof as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered,\\nand always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.\\nThey settled in town, received very liberal assistance\\nfrom Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable\\nwith the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies\\nand ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well\\nas the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and\\nLucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which\\nthey all lived together.\\n\\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest\\nson, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what\\nRobert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them\\nstill more.  It was an arrangement, however, justified in\\nits effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever\\nappeared in Robert\\'s style of living or of talking to give\\na suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,\\nas either leaving his brother too little, or bringing\\nhimself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from\\nthe ready discharge of his duties in every particular,\\nfrom an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,\\nhe might be supposed no less contented with his lot,\\nno less free from every wish of an exchange.\\n\\nElinor\\'s marriage divided her as little from her\\nfamily as could well be contrived, without rendering\\nthe cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother\\nand sisters spent much more than half their time with her.\\nMrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford;\\nfor her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together\\nwas hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than\\nwhat John had expressed.  It was now her darling object.\\nPrecious as was the company of her daughter to her,\\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant\\nenjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at\\nthe mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.\\nThey each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,\\nand Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward\\nof all.\\n\\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge\\nso intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond\\nattachment to herself, which at last, though long after it\\nwas observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she\\ndo?\\n\\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.\\nShe was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,\\nand to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.\\nShe was born to overcome an affection formed so late\\nin life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship,\\nvoluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,\\na man who had suffered no less than herself under the\\nevent of a former attachment, whom, two years before,\\nshe had considered too old to be married,--and who still\\nsought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\\n\\nBut so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice\\nto an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly\\nflattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining\\neven for ever with her mother, and finding her only\\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her\\nmore calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--\\nshe found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,\\nentering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,\\nthe mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\\n\\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best\\nloved him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he\\nwas consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her\\nsociety restored his mind to animation, and his spirits\\nto cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness\\nin forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight\\nof each observing friend.  Marianne could never love\\nby halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much\\ndevoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.\\n\\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without\\na pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete\\nin the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating\\nhis marriage with a woman of character, as the source\\nof her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have\\nbeen happy and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct,\\nwhich thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,\\nneed not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel\\nBrandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But that\\nhe was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,\\nor contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a\\nbroken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.\\nHe lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.\\nHis wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\\nalways uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable\\ndegree of domestic felicity.\\n\\nFor Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility\\nin surviving her loss--he always retained that decided\\nregard which interested him in every thing that befell her,\\nand made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--\\nand many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in\\nafter-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage,\\nwithout attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for\\nSir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,\\nMargaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,\\nand not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.\\n\\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant\\ncommunication which strong family affection would\\nnaturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness\\nof Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least\\nconsiderable, that though sisters, and living almost within\\nsight of each other, they could live without disagreement\\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n'"
